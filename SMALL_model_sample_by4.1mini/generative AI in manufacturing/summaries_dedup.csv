It summarizes findings from a systematic PRISMA-based literature review of over 1,200 papers, narrowing down to 168 relevant studies primarily employing Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs).

This survey categorizes RL applications in generative AI into three main types: (1) RL as an alternative generation method approximating data distributions, (2) RL for generating outputs while maximizing objective functions such as BLEU or aesthetic scores, and (3) RL for embedding nuanced, subjective characteristics not easily captured by explicit objectives, often via reward modeling and human or AI feedback. Key RL methods include policy gradients, hierarchical RL, and actor-critic algorithms, applied to tasks ranging from text and code generation to chemistry and image synthesis. Challenges involve managing large sparse action spaces, high computational cost, reward bias, robustness to adversarial behaviors, and the risks of optimizing flawed evaluation metrics (Goodharts law).
