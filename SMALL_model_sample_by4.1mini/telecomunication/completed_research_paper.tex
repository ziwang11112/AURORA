\subsection{Overview of AI-Driven Approaches in Adaptive Control, Telecommunications, and Networking Systems}

The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into adaptive control, telecommunications, and dynamic networking systems has catalyzed unprecedented advancements, fundamentally reshaping traditional paradigms by introducing data-driven adaptability and autonomous decision-making. Foundational studies have demonstrated AI's potential in optimizing networks via reinforcement learning, enabling autonomous control mechanisms within communication systems, and developing adaptive AI models designed for dynamic protocol adjustment \cite{ref17,ref18,ref19,ref20}. These approaches leverage the inherent dynamics of networks by utilizing system state information alongside historical interactions, thereby empowering networks to self-optimize under diverse and time-varying conditions \cite{ref1,ref2,ref3}. Furthermore, AI techniques have addressed the complexities presented by distributed and heterogeneous network infrastructures, effectively tackling challenges such as resource contention, delay variability, and fault tolerance \cite{ref4,ref5,ref6}. 

Despite significant progress, persistent challenges remain, notably in managing computational overhead, sustaining real-time inference under tight latency requirements, and ensuring robustness against network uncertainties and adversarial perturbations \cite{ref7,ref8,ref9}. The breadth of AI integration spans from automated network traffic classification to autonomous fault management, covering both physical-layer optimization and higher-layer protocol adaptation \cite{ref10,ref49,ref50}. This evolving landscape is underscored by the convergence of AI methodologies with emerging network architectures, highlighting the critical need for frameworks that balance performance gains while ensuring scalability and interoperability.

\subsection{Motivation for AI Integration}

The telecommunications and networking sectors are witnessing accelerated growth characterized by increasing data volume, heterogeneous device ecosystems, and complex service requirements, especially within vector databases, wireless networking infrastructures, software-defined networking (SDN), and Open Radio Access Network (Open RAN) architectures \cite{ref21,ref22,ref23}. The transition to 5G/6G and beyond-6G (B6G) technologies demands adaptive, intelligent mechanisms capable of managing escalating complexity, enabling dynamic resource allocation, and optimizing real-time performance \cite{ref24,ref25}. AI techniques have demonstrated substantial benefits in these areas by facilitating model-free, context-aware decisions that optimize network slicing, enhance spectrum utilization, and enable hybrid fusion strategies such as combining visible light communication (VLC) and radio frequency (RF) systems \cite{ref51,ref52}. Additionally, AI-empowered sophisticated detection methods and adaptive interference cancellation schemes have proven effective in mitigating wireless channel impairments, thereby improving reliability and throughput \cite{ref54,ref55}. 

Real-world validations of these AI approaches affirm their practical applicability yet underscore ongoing challenges related to data heterogeneity, privacy preservation, and smooth integration with legacy systems. Consequently, AI integration is driven not only by the pursuit of performance enhancements but also by the imperative to endow networks with self-adaptive intelligence essential to address the demands and uncertainties characteristic of next-generation telecommunication ecosystems.

\subsection{Key AI Techniques and Their Roles}

A diverse array of AI methodologies has been harnessed to enhance adaptability and performance within communication networks. Reinforcement learning (RL) constitutes a foundational technique for dynamic resource management, enabling agents to learn optimal policies related to bandwidth allocation, routing, and scheduling through continuous interaction with the environment, absent explicit modeling \cite{ref11,ref12}. Gradient-based optimization methods, such as stochastic dual gradient techniques and their variants, facilitate efficient parameter updates in resource-constrained settings while providing provable convergence and queue stability assurances in large-scale network control problems \cite{ref13,ref14}. Rapid algorithmic updates, often leveraging modular and distributed architectures, permit real-time adaptability essential for environments characterized by fluctuating traffic patterns and volatile channel conditions \cite{ref15}. 

Moreover, intelligent wireless technologies, including AI-powered reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS), deep learning-driven interference management frameworks, and semantic communications, enhance physical-layer operations by dynamically shaping signal propagation and improving resilience against noise and interference \cite{ref16,ref49,ref50}. Collectively, these AI techniques contribute to a multi-layered intelligence framework, integrating decision-making processes from physical-layer signal optimization to network-layer control and application-specific adaptations.

\subsection{Challenges in AI-Enabled Networking}

Despite these technological advances, AI-enabled networking faces critical challenges that hinder widespread implementation and effectiveness. Latency remains a stringent constraint, particularly pertinent to ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC) and tactile Internet applications, where inference delays and model update latencies may negate potential AI-driven optimization benefits \cite{ref26,ref27}. Scalability issues emerge in large-scale, dynamic networks encompassing massive numbers of IoT and mobile devices; centralized AI architectures often encounter prohibitive computational burdens and excessive data transfer overhead \cite{ref28}. Privacy concerns are exacerbated by the reliance on sensitive user data and distributed learning paradigms, motivating the adoption of privacy-preserving algorithms such as federated learning—which, however, introduce additional complexities in synchronization and heterogeneity management \cite{ref29,ref52}. 

Interoperability remains challenging due to the diversity of vendor-specific implementations and the absence of standardized AI protocols, complicating seamless integration across multi-domain infrastructures \cite{ref30,ref48}. Additionally, ensuring robustness against network dynamics and adversarial attacks is difficult since AI models frequently assume stationary environments and may degrade significantly under previously unseen conditions or malicious perturbations \cite{ref49,ref50,ref53}. These multifaceted challenges emphasize the necessity for scalable, secure, and interpretable AI frameworks capable of reliable operation within heterogeneous, dynamic network ecosystems.

\subsection{Scope and Structure of the Survey}

This survey systematically examines AI applications across pivotal networking domains, spanning from network traffic classification to autonomous fault management within software-driven infrastructures \cite{ref31,ref32}. It offers an in-depth exploration of AI methodologies designed specifically for software-defined networking (SDN), routing optimization, Open RAN architectures, and dynamic network slicing \cite{ref33,ref34,ref35}. To evaluate the effectiveness of various AI approaches within these domains, key performance metrics such as throughput, latency, accuracy, scalability, and robustness are employed \cite{ref51,ref52}. 

The survey places emphasis on both foundational frameworks and emerging trends, integrating insights from classical algorithmic control methods with contemporary deep learning and reinforcement learning techniques. By synthesizing recent advances, trade-offs, and open research challenges, this work elucidates the multifaceted roles of AI in enhancing network adaptability and operational efficiency. It aims to provide a comprehensive foundation that informs and guides future research and development in intelligent communication networks.

\section{2. AI-Enabled Network Traffic Classification}

\subsection{2.1. Limitations of Traditional Traffic Classification Methods}

Traditional network traffic classification methods, including port-based identification and deep packet inspection (DPI), display significant limitations in contemporary network environments. Port-based approaches depend heavily on static assumptions about port assignments, which are increasingly invalid due to dynamic port allocations and tunneling protocols. DPI offers finer granularity by examining packet payloads; however, it becomes largely ineffective when traffic is encrypted, as payload contents are no longer accessible. Additionally, DPI raises privacy concerns and demands considerable computational resources, which may not be sustainable in high-throughput or resource-constrained systems. Collectively, these challenges undermine the practicality of conventional methods in handling encrypted and dynamically changing traffic patterns, thereby motivating the shift towards adaptive, data-driven classification techniques \cite{ref51}.

\subsection{2.2. Machine Learning Approaches for Traffic Classification}

Advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning (ML) introduce powerful alternatives that address the shortcomings of classical methods by utilizing statistical and behavioral traffic characteristics, which remain accessible even when payload encryption is enforced. Supervised learning algorithms—such as decision trees, random forests, support vector machines (SVM), k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), and neural networks—have been widely deployed to classify traffic flows based on features extracted from packet sizes, inter-arrival times, and flow durations \cite{ref51}. These methods rely on labeled datasets to establish decision boundaries and have demonstrated high accuracy under controlled experimental conditions.

In parallel, unsupervised learning techniques, especially clustering algorithms, identify anomalous or previously unseen traffic patterns without the necessity for labeled data. This capability is essential for adapting to new network behaviors and detecting emerging threats, complementing supervised classifiers by providing a dynamic and flexible detection framework \cite{ref51}.

Beyond traditional ML, deep learning methodologies leverage architectures such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to automatically learn hierarchical feature representations and capture temporal dependencies intrinsic to sequential packet flows. These models excel particularly in scenarios where encryption obfuscates payload data since they depend on flow-level statistical patterns to maintain classification effectiveness \cite{ref1,ref6,ref51}. Nonetheless, the increased computational complexity and training demands of deep learning models pose challenges for large-scale experimentation and real-time deployment.

\subsection{2.3. Data Pipeline Processes}

The success of AI-based traffic classification frameworks fundamentally depends on constructing a robust data pipeline that encompasses several crucial stages: traffic collection, preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and performance evaluation.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Traffic collection} must ensure comprehensive and representative sampling across diverse network conditions to capture the complexity of real-world traffic.

\item \textbf{Preprocessing} addresses issues such as missing data, noise, and feature normalization to promote consistent input distributions.

\item \textbf{Feature extraction} often constitutes the critical phase influencing classifier performance. It involves computing statistical metrics derived from both flow-level and packet-level attributes; some approaches incorporate payload-based features when permitted.

\item \textbf{Model training} utilizes large-scale, balanced datasets to prevent bias toward dominant classes and improve generalization.

\item \textbf{Evaluation} rigorously measures classifier performance through metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and processing latency \cite{ref51}.

Maintaining this lifecycle is essential to ensure classifier robustness, particularly in the face of evolving network conditions and potential domain shifts.

\subsection{2.4. Performance Trade-offs}

Implementing AI-powered classifiers in operational networks entails managing intrinsic trade-offs among accuracy, computational complexity, and real-time feasibility. Ensemble techniques like random forests and gradient boosting offer robust and interpretable predictive performance at moderate computational costs but may exhibit limitations in handling encrypted traffic or adapting rapidly to changes \cite{ref51}. On the other hand, deep learning models enhance the capacity for feature abstraction and temporal modeling, yielding superior classification of complex or obfuscated traffic patterns. However, these gains often incur elevated inference latency and resource consumption, which can hinder scalability and edge deployment.

Real-time operation necessitates balancing detection speed with classification precision. Emerging adaptive frameworks integrating incremental and online learning aim to alleviate retraining overhead and swiftly adjust to concept drift but remain areas of active investigation \cite{ref51}.

\subsection{2.5. Challenges and Emerging Directions}

Despite substantial progress, AI-enabled network traffic classification continues to confront several key challenges:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Data imbalance}: Common traffic classes typically dominate datasets, which biases models and degrades sensitivity to rare or malicious traffic.
    \item \textbf{Encrypted traffic}: Encryption limits visibility into payloads, restricting the feature space available for classification and complicating detection.
    \item \textbf{Concept drift}: Network behaviors evolve over time, requiring continuous model updates to sustain classification accuracy.
    \item \textbf{Dataset representativeness}: Publicly available benchmarks often lack sufficient diversity or scale, limiting the generalizability and transferability of models across different network environments \cite{ref51}.
\end{itemize}

Promising future directions address these challenges by leveraging scalable learning paradigms such as semi-supervised and federated learning. Semi-supervised methods exploit abundant unlabeled data to enhance model performance, whereas federated learning enables distributed privacy-preserving training by aggregating locally trained models without sharing raw traffic data \cite{ref49,ref50,ref51}. Federated approaches are particularly advantageous for real-time edge inference and compliance with stringent data privacy regulations.

Explainability has become an indispensable dimension in deploying AI classifiers, facilitating network operators' understanding of model decisions, uncovering potential biases, and fulfilling auditing requirements. Techniques that incorporate interpretable model components or provide post-hoc explanations are increasingly adopted in this domain.

Furthermore, integration with edge computing infrastructures heralds a paradigm shift, decentralizing inference closer to the data sources. This proximity reduces latency and bandwidth consumption while enhancing scalability and robustness. The synergy between AI and edge computing thus enables more responsive and efficient network traffic classification systems \cite{ref51}.

In summary, AI-enabled traffic classification constitutes a transformative advancement over traditional methods by effectively adapting to encrypted, dynamic, and heterogeneous network traffic. Continued innovation targeting computational efficiency, data challenges, interpretability, and privacy is crucial to achieve seamless integration within operational network environments.

\section{AI Integration in Software-Defined Networking (SDN) for 5G and Beyond}

\subsection{AI-Powered SDN Architectures}

The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) within Software-Defined Networking (SDN) architectures has fundamentally transformed network control paradigms by enabling highly centralized, programmable, and intelligent decision-making frameworks. AI enhances the SDN controller’s ability to dynamically adapt to fluctuating network conditions and heterogeneous traffic demands typical of 5G environments, thereby facilitating scalable and automated network management \cite{ref52}. This architectural synergy leverages AI’s pattern recognition and predictive analytics to optimize resource allocation and policy enforcement, while abstracting underlying hardware complexities. However, balancing the benefits of centralized control against the computational demands and latency constraints inherent in deploying sophisticated AI models in real-time network operations remains a significant challenge.

\subsection{AI Techniques in SDN}

Within SDN controllers, AI techniques primarily encompass supervised machine learning classifiers such as Random Forests and Support Vector Machines (SVM). These models effectively manage traffic classification and anomaly detection tasks by providing robust and interpretable decision boundaries suited to identifying diverse traffic patterns under varying network states \cite{ref52}. In parallel, deep learning architectures—particularly Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks—offer distinct advantages by capturing temporal dependencies and sequence dynamics in traffic flows, which are critical for modeling network behavior amidst temporal volatility \cite{ref52}. The complementary utilization of shallow classifiers alongside deep recurrent networks creates a holistic framework that adapts to both static features and dynamic temporal shifts within network traffic. Despite these benefits, training such complex models demands extensive labeled datasets and substantial computational resources, posing scalability challenges for practical deployments.

\subsection{Performance Improvements}

Empirical studies confirm that AI-enhanced SDN architectures yield significant improvements across key network performance metrics. Specifically, supervised and deep learning models have achieved traffic classification accuracies up to 92\%, markedly reducing misclassification errors that degrade service quality \cite{ref52}. These accuracy enhancements translate directly into improved throughput, with reports indicating increases close to 15\% in enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB) scenarios, owing to more precise resource scheduling and traffic steering. Furthermore, latency reductions of approximately 18\% in end-to-end communications have been observed, attributable to AI’s rapid anomaly detection and real-time traffic adaptation capabilities \cite{ref52}. Equally critical is the reduction in false positive rates for anomaly detection to below 3\%, which significantly minimizes unnecessary mitigation actions that could otherwise impair network efficiency. Collectively, these benefits underscore AI’s pivotal role in elevating Quality of Service (QoS) metrics and responsiveness in the inherently volatile 5G network environments.

\subsection{Challenges}

Despite these advancements, deploying AI-powered SDN frameworks encounters several substantive obstacles that limit operational scalability and security. Foremost among these is the substantial computational overhead introduced by sophisticated AI models, which may hinder timely inference essential for ultra-low-latency applications \cite{ref52}. Additionally, the scarcity of telecom-specific datasets presents a major barrier to supervised learning, given that annotated network traffic data is often limited, proprietary, or sensitive, thereby constraining model generalizability and robustness \cite{ref7}. Moreover, adversarial AI attacks pose significant security threats, as malicious actors may exploit vulnerabilities within AI models to induce erroneous decisions or evade detection \cite{ref48}. Interoperability challenges also arise due to heterogeneous vendor equipment and divergent technological standards, complicating seamless AI integration across multi-domain and multi-vendor SDN deployments \cite{ref7}. Addressing these issues requires innovations not only in algorithmic design but also in collaborative frameworks that promote data sharing and standardize protocols across the telecom ecosystem.

\subsection{Prospects Beyond 5G (6G)}

Looking ahead, the evolution toward beyond 5G networks, particularly 6G, envisions the development of lightweight, privacy-preserving AI models specifically tailored for distributed SDN environments \cite{ref49,ref50}. Federated learning stands out as a promising approach, enabling collaborative model training across decentralized network nodes without the need to expose sensitive data, thus mitigating privacy and security concerns intrinsic to centralized data aggregation \cite{ref52}. Additionally, anticipated advancements in multi-modal AI architectures, including large language models and multi-sensor data fusion, are expected to enhance situational awareness and optimize network performance beyond current temporal and spatial constraints \cite{ref52}. These emerging technologies will be critical in meeting stringent 6G requirements such as ultra-reliability, massive connectivity, and real-time intelligence. Nonetheless, realizing federated and privacy-aware AI solutions demands overcoming substantial computational, communication, and standardization challenges, necessitating interdisciplinary research efforts bridging AI, communications, and network engineering disciplines \cite{ref49,ref50}.

\subsection*{Summary}

In summary, the integration of AI into SDN for 5G networks has catalyzed substantial improvements in network adaptability and performance, despite persistent computational and security challenges. The ongoing transition toward 6G mandates the design of optimized, distributed AI frameworks capable of balancing intelligence, efficiency, and privacy—representing the next frontier in programmable and autonomous network architectures.

\subsection{4. AI-Driven Routing Optimization}

#### 4.1. Limitations of Static Routing Protocols

Traditional static routing protocols lack the adaptability necessary for dynamic and heterogeneous network environments, leading to suboptimal performance under varying traffic patterns and network conditions. Originally designed for relatively stable and homogeneous infrastructures, these protocols exhibit limited real-time responsiveness to fluctuating workloads, mobility-induced topology changes, and unpredictable link failures. As a result, challenges such as increased latency, reduced throughput, and vulnerability to faults frequently arise in large-scale, multi-tenant networks typical of modern wireless and software-defined architectures \cite{ref53}. Moreover, the rigidity inherent in static routing constrains efficient resource utilization and impedes the exploitation of cross-layer contextual information, which is critical for advancing 5G and beyond networks.

#### 4.2. Reinforcement Learning and Neural Networks for Routing

Artificial intelligence (AI) approaches, especially reinforcement learning (RL) and neural networks (NNs), offer powerful tools to overcome the limitations of static routing by enabling adaptive, data-driven path optimization. RL algorithms dynamically explore and exploit routing policies, simultaneously optimizing objectives such as throughput maximization, latency minimization, and fault tolerance enhancement \cite{ref4}. This facilitates dynamic path prediction that responds directly to real-time network states. Complementarily, neural networks learn complex nonlinear mappings from network observations to optimal routing decisions, effectively generalizing from historical data and adapting to novel scenarios \cite{ref17}\textemdash\cite{ref20}. Together, these AI-driven methods support autonomous routing frameworks capable of adjusting to heterogeneous node capabilities and traffic demands, outperforming traditional heuristics through improved robustness and scalability.

Nevertheless, significant challenges persist. Balancing the exploration-exploitation trade-off in RL demands meticulous algorithmic design, while avoiding model overfitting to specific network conditions requires continuous retraining \cite{ref53}. Empirical studies have demonstrated that AI-empowered routing schemes can enhance throughput and reduce latency by up to 30% compared to static routing protocols, additionally incorporating fault tolerance through rapid anomaly-driven rerouting \cite{ref4}.

#### 4.3. Traffic Prediction and Anomaly Detection Integration

The incorporation of traffic prediction and anomaly detection into routing optimization represents a critical advancement, enabling proactive rather than reactive network management. Traffic prediction models—often based on supervised learning or time-series deep learning architectures—forecast network load and congestion trends, thereby informing route selection ahead of potential performance degradation \cite{ref50}. Simultaneously, anomaly detection systems identify deviations such as link failures, cyber-attacks, or misconfigurations, enabling timely rerouting decisions that preserve service quality \cite{ref53}. This combination of predictive and reactive strategies enhances overall network resilience and throughput by preempting bottlenecks and limiting fault propagation.

However, accuracy in traffic forecasting is challenged by the non-stationary and volatile nature of network environments, compounded by data heterogeneity and large volumes. Similarly, anomaly detection mechanisms must carefully balance sensitivity and specificity to minimize false positives, which could otherwise provoke unnecessary path changes. Achieving this balance requires developing robust models trained on diverse datasets \cite{ref50}. Integrating these components within an AI-driven routing framework enables multi-objective optimization that simultaneously addresses performance, reliability, and security.

#### 4.4. Empirical Gains and Challenges

Experimental validations of AI-driven routing protocols consistently demonstrate substantial gains, including increased throughput, reduced latency, and improved fault tolerance across diverse network topologies and traffic scenarios \cite{ref4}. Despite these advantages, scaling AI models to large-scale, high-speed networks entails significant computational and communication overheads, especially within centralized learning architectures \cite{ref53}. Additionally, security vulnerabilities arise from adversarial attacks that can manipulate training data or model inference, thereby degrading routing efficiency.

Integrating AI models with legacy network infrastructures introduces further complexity, necessitating hybrid or modular deployment approaches to ensure backward compatibility without service disruption \cite{ref48}. The requirements for real-time inference combined with continuous model updates intensify these challenges, creating trade-offs among accuracy, responsiveness, and resource consumption. Overcoming these limitations calls for advances in lightweight model designs, distributed learning frameworks, and robust security protocols specially tailored for network environments.

#### 4.5. Future Trends

Emerging directions in AI-based routing optimization focus on decentralized and federated learning architectures to surmount scalability and privacy limitations inherent in centralized approaches. Federated learning enables distributed clients or network nodes to collaboratively train shared models without exposing sensitive local data, thus safeguarding privacy and reducing communication overheads \cite{ref53}. Robust federated frameworks employ adaptive client selection and gradient sparsification to efficiently manage heterogeneous device capabilities and mitigate client dropout, which enhances convergence rates and accuracy under practical wireless network conditions \cite{ref49}.

Moreover, hybrid algorithms that integrate AI techniques with conventional routing protocols show promise for providing adaptive yet lightweight routing solutions, facilitating seamless transitions and backward compatibility. These hybrids leverage heuristic strengths while augmenting adaptability and predictive performance through machine learning components. Future research priorities include developing federated, privacy-preserving, and resource-efficient AI algorithms; integrating explainability and transparency features for operational trust; and expanding applicability to nascent paradigms such as 6G networks, massive MIMO, and edge computing ecosystems \cite{ref53}. These advancements will be crucial for achieving fully autonomous, scalable, and resilient network routing architectures.

\section{5. AI in Open Radio Access Network (Open RAN) for 6G}

\subsection{5.1 Open RAN Architecture and AI Integration Layers}

Open RAN introduces a transformative approach to wireless network infrastructure by disaggregating traditionally monolithic radio access components into three distinct units: the Radio Unit (RU), Distributed Unit (DU), and Centralized Unit (CU). This modular design fosters openness and programmability through well-defined interfaces, enabling accelerated innovation and increased vendor diversity. A pivotal advancement in Open RAN is the multilayer integration of artificial intelligence (AI), which enhances network intelligence by embedding AI capabilities at each architectural layer to systematically tackle unique operational challenges and holistically optimize performance \cite{ref54}.

At the RU level, AI models are designed for real-time radio signal processing and physical layer optimizations, operating under stringent latency constraints. The DU employs AI to manage scheduling, resource allocation, and local interference mitigation, leveraging moderate computational power and localized datasets. Meanwhile, the CU is responsible for executing complex AI analytics on aggregated network-wide telemetry, facilitating dynamic orchestration, fault detection, and long-term network optimization. This hierarchical AI deployment balances computational complexity and latency demands to ensure both scalability and responsiveness across network layers.

\subsection{5.2 AI Techniques in Open RAN}

A diverse array of AI techniques underpins Open RAN functionalities, each selected to meet specific operational objectives. Federated learning is particularly prominent, enabling distributed model training across RU, DU, and CU layers without direct raw data sharing. This decentralization preserves user privacy and addresses the multi-vendor and multi-domain heterogeneity inherent to Open RAN environments \cite{ref54}. Reinforcement learning (RL), especially deep RL, empowers autonomous decision-making for dynamic spectrum management, adaptive resource allocation, and interference mitigation by learning optimal policies through environment interaction \cite{ref21,ref22}. Deep neural networks (DNNs) are widely utilized for tasks requiring sophisticated pattern recognition and nonlinear mapping, such as fault detection and anomaly identification, capitalizing on the large volumes of telemetry data available \cite{ref23,ref24}.

Moreover, hybrid fusion techniques integrating modalities such as visible light communication (VLC) and radio frequency (RF) exemplify AI’s adaptability in managing heterogeneous communication channels and mitigating interference \cite{ref25}. This VLC-RF hybrid interface uses machine learning-based fusion and interference cancellation algorithms to enhance robustness in complex environments. Additionally, AI-driven sequence management strategies optimize preamble sequence design, significantly reducing collision probabilities in random access channels; this advance is critical for supporting massive IoT device connectivity in 5G and upcoming 6G networks \cite{ref21}. Despite these successes, deployment challenges remain, particularly concerning the computational overhead of real-time model training and the coordination of AI functionalities across heterogeneous multi-vendor equipment \cite{ref49}.

\subsection{5.3 Performance Enhancements}

Integrating AI into Open RAN architectures markedly improves key network performance metrics, including throughput, latency, energy efficiency, reliability, and resource utilization. AI-driven algorithms enable dynamic spectrum access and intelligent scheduling that adapt bandwidth allocation responsively to fluctuating traffic and complex interference conditions, thus boosting effective throughput and minimizing latency \cite{ref54}. Energy efficiency is enhanced through AI-enabled resource optimization and hardware-aware scheduling schemes, which selectively power down idle components or scale computing tasks based on real-time network load, contributing to greener operations \cite{ref49}.

Reliability and connection robustness benefit from AI-based proactive fault detection and predictive maintenance, which facilitate early identification of anomalies before service degradation occurs. For example, reinforcement learning algorithms dynamically adjust handover parameters, reducing connection drops and improving mobility management \cite{ref54}. Furthermore, AI improves resource utilization by analyzing extensive telemetry data to identify bottlenecks and redundant allocations, thereby facilitating efficient network slicing and large-scale multi-access edge computing (MEC) deployments \cite{ref49}.

\subsection{5.4 Challenges}

Despite these substantial gains, embedding AI within Open RAN poses several critical challenges. Model convergence is an ongoing concern, particularly in dynamic, non-stationary wireless environments where partial observability can destabilize reinforcement learning and distributed training processes \cite{ref54}. High computational demands for training and inference at edge units such as RUs and DUs, which have limited processing capabilities, impose stringent resource limitations. Addressing these demands requires advances in lightweight AI models and the development of efficient hardware accelerators \cite{ref48}.

Multi-vendor interoperability remains complex due to heterogeneity in hardware capabilities, proprietary implementations, and disparate data formats, complicating the standardization and seamless integration of AI functionalities within the Open RAN ecosystem \cite{ref49}. The deployment of AI also intensifies security and privacy risks; adversarial attacks targeting AI models, data leakage during federated learning updates, and vulnerabilities in distributed AI protocols necessitate robust defense mechanisms and stringent regulatory compliance \cite{ref50}. Additionally, compliance with evolving telecommunications regulations—including data sovereignty and transparency requirements—imposes operational constraints on AI algorithm design and deployment \cite{ref48}.

\subsection{5.5 Future Research Directions}

Future research must prioritize explainability and transparency of AI decision-making within Open RAN to build trust, satisfy regulatory requirements, and facilitate efficient troubleshooting. Explainable AI (XAI) approaches will provide clarity on AI-driven resource allocations and fault detection processes, which is especially crucial in multi-stakeholder environments \cite{ref54}. The development of multi-agent collaborative learning frameworks is expected to enhance distributed AI systems, enabling coordinated intelligence across RU, DU, and CU layers to address complex cross-layer optimization challenges intrinsic to 6G \cite{ref48}.

The creation of lightweight AI models specifically tailored for resource-constrained edge units, alongside dedicated hardware accelerators, is essential for overcoming computational and energy bottlenecks \cite{ref50}. Emerging paradigms such as quantum computing hold promise for tackling complex optimization problems in Open RAN, while blockchain technologies can bolster security, data integrity, and decentralized trust—key enablers for multi-vendor ecosystems \cite{ref54}. Integrating these emerging technologies with AI will advance Open RAN capabilities, laying the foundation for fully autonomous, resilient, and high-performance next-generation wireless networks.

\section{Large Language Model-Driven Agentic AI for O-RAN Network Resilience}

\subsection{Embedding LLM-Based Agents in RAN Intelligent Controller and SMO}

The integration of Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents within the Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architecture—specifically within components such as the near Real-Time RAN Intelligent Controller (Near-RT RIC) and Service Management and Orchestration (SMO)—represents a fundamental advancement toward autonomous fault management. Embedding these agents enables continuous, context-aware monitoring of network telemetry coupled with dynamic remediation strategies executed without human intervention. This level of autonomy surpasses traditional rule-based or supervised learning systems, which typically depend on predefined fault catalogs or manual threshold triggers. Leveraging the intrinsic capability of LLMs to parse and synthesize diverse network state information, agentic AI systems can interpret a broad spectrum of fault manifestations and implement tailored corrective actions, such as dynamic resource re-allocation and service re-configuration, all within stringent near-RT latency constraints \cite{ref55}. Furthermore, coupling LLM-based agents with the modular, open interfaces inherent to the O-RAN framework facilitates customizable agent behaviors and scalable deployments, thereby enhancing operational flexibility and significantly reducing mitigation time for complex fault scenarios.

\subsection{Natural Language Processing for Fault Interpretation and Interaction}

A critical enabler of LLM-driven agentic AI efficacy is the application of advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques for fault interpretation and human-machine interaction. Unlike traditional, deterministic fault detection frameworks that are limited to numeric alarms or discrete indicators, LLMs process heterogeneous data outputs—including logs, alerts, and operator annotations—with semantic comprehension, enabling nuanced fault diagnosis. This sophisticated capability allows agents not only to detect and localize faults but also to contextualize root causes within operational narratives, thereby facilitating coherent, meaningful communication with human operators \cite{ref55}. Such NLP-enabled interaction enhances transparency and fosters operator trust, a vital factor given the inherent risks of erroneous decisions in fully autonomous systems. Moreover, the capacity for agents to articulate mitigation strategies, justify their decisions, and incorporate real-time operator feedback ensures the integration of human oversight alongside agent autonomy, thus addressing critical concerns related to model interpretability and acceptance during live network operations.

\subsection{Experimental Achievements}

Empirical evaluations substantiate that incorporating LLM-based agentic AI into O-RAN architecture substantially elevates fault management performance. Experimental data demonstrate marked improvements, with fault detection accuracy reaching up to 95\%, compared to baseline values near 78\%. Mitigation success rates increase by over 20\%, accompanied by a 40\% reduction in network downtime and a decrease in throughput degradation from approximately 25\% down to 10\% \cite{ref46, ref55, ref27}. These tangible improvements in network robustness arise from agents' proactive fault anticipation and multifaceted response capabilities, which significantly outperform traditional heuristic or static rule-based methods prone to delayed or incomplete reactions \cite{ref27}. Notably, throughput gains reflect effective real-time resource optimization and adaptive reconfiguration managed directly by agents embedded within the RIC and SMO layers, thereby validating the operational feasibility and efficacy of this architectural approach.

\subsection{Comparative Performance Analysis}

When compared to conventional fault management techniques reliant on manual or semi-automated processes, LLM-driven agentic AI exhibits superior adaptability and resilience. Traditional methods frequently fail to capture the intricate interdependencies and temporal dynamics inherent in multi-source network data, resulting in suboptimal fault isolation and extended recovery times. In contrast, LLM agents synthesize multimodal inputs and apply contextual reasoning to enable expedited and more accurate fault classification and resolution pathways \cite{ref55}. Additionally, the continuous learning capabilities embedded in these agent architectures promote sustained performance improvements by adapting dynamically to evolving network topologies and traffic profiles. This operational advantage positions agentic AI as a markedly superior solution for managing the increasing heterogeneity and scale of next-generation wireless infrastructures.

\subsection{Recognized Challenges}

Despite these significant advancements, deploying LLM-based agentic AI within O-RAN architectures poses several critical challenges. First, the computational overhead associated with large-scale LLM inference raises concerns regarding latency and energy efficiency, particularly within edge environments constrained by limited resources \cite{ref55, ref48}. Second, inaccuracies arising from incomplete or noisy input data, model bias, or adversarial conditions threaten network stability by potentially inducing erroneous decisions. Third, AI-specific security vulnerabilities—including data poisoning and model inversion attacks—necessitate stringent and multilayered safeguards. Finally, ensuring interoperability of LLM agents across heterogeneous multi-vendor ecosystems—each characterized by proprietary interfaces and diverse data semantics—remains an unresolved issue complicating standardized deployment \cite{ref55, ref48}. Collectively, these challenges underscore the complexity of operationalizing agentic AI at scale, without compromising network performance or reliability.

\subsection{Proposed Solutions and Optimizations}

To address the aforementioned challenges, several strategies have been proposed. A hierarchical agent design paradigm advocates for lightweight, edge-deployable agents managing real-time, low-level tasks, while delegating more computationally intensive LLM operations to centralized or cloud environments. This approach balances computational load with latency requirements effectively \cite{ref55}. Rigorous validation frameworks that incorporate simulated fault injection and continuous model retraining serve to reduce erroneous actions and bolster model robustness. Resource-constrained edge deployment benefits from optimization techniques such as model pruning, quantization, and knowledge distillation, which reduce computational demands without incurring significant accuracy degradation. Additionally, the adoption of standardized open interfaces and semantic data models within the O-RAN architecture enhances interoperability and facilitates adaptation across multiple vendor implementations, thereby addressing the complexity inherent in multi-vendor ecosystems \cite{ref55}. Collectively, these solutions constitute a comprehensive pathway toward practical and scalable deployment of LLM-driven agentic AI.

\subsection{Future Directions}

Future research endeavors focus on several pivotal areas aiming to advance agentic AI capabilities. Enhancing multi-agent coordination to enable cooperative fault detection and mitigation across distributed RAN contexts promises to improve resilience through collective intelligence \cite{ref21}. Advancements in explainability methods remain critical to demystify agent decision-making processes, thereby fostering greater operator trust and aiding compliance with regulatory frameworks \cite{ref48}. Strengthening security through adversarial training, secure model update protocols, and anomaly detection constitutes an imperative to safeguard agentic AI frameworks against emerging cyber threats \cite{ref50}. Furthermore, integrating adaptive resource allocation and intelligent sequence management techniques offers potential for further optimization of network performance under dynamically changing conditions \cite{ref21}. Collectively, these future directions emphasize the increasing complexity of O-RAN networks and highlight the central role that sophisticated AI agents will play in ensuring their continued resilience and operational excellence.

\section{7. Adaptive Control and Reinforcement Learning in Networking Systems}

\subsection{7.1 Applications of Reinforcement Learning}

Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a crucial methodology for real-time adaptive control in dynamic and wireless networking environments. RL enables optimization of system performance under stochastic and time-varying conditions by learning policies that map network states to appropriate actions through direct interaction with the environment \cite{ref2, ref5, ref7, ref12, ref31, ref32, ref33, ref34, ref35, ref50}. This approach contrasts with traditional model-based control methods that depend on fixed policies or heuristics, offering autonomous decision-making tailored to the complexities inherent in modern networks.

RL's versatility is demonstrated across diverse networking scenarios, including cellular self-organized networks (SON) and multi-hop wireless ad hoc systems, where it addresses critical challenges such as interference mitigation, handover optimization, and load balancing \cite{ref31, ref32, ref33, ref34, ref35}. In particular, deep RL (DRL) variants are notable for enabling rapid adaptation without explicit model dependencies, which is vital in heterogeneous and uncertain wireless contexts.

The success of RL-based adaptive control systems depends heavily on accurate and expressive state representations capable of handling high-dimensional and partially observable environments. Recent literature highlights the synergy between RL and deep neural networks to extract pertinent features and exploit spatial-temporal correlations, thereby accelerating convergence \cite{ref31, ref32, ref33}. Despite such progress, enduring challenges include maintaining robustness in the face of non-stationary traffic and fluctuating wireless channels. To address these, research on meta-learning and transfer learning is gaining importance, aimed at improving generalization across varying network states \cite{ref35}. Moreover, deployment in latency-sensitive settings is constrained by the computational overhead of RL inference, driving development toward lightweight models and hardware-accelerated implementations.

\subsection{7.2 Deep Reinforcement Learning for Online Adaptation}

Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) advances conventional RL by employing deep neural networks as function approximators for policies or value functions. This facilitates effective online adaptation for complex tasks such as decision-making, resource allocation, and adaptive bandwidth management in networking systems \cite{ref4, ref8, ref13, ref15, ref50}. DRL has proven especially useful in scenarios characterized by high-dimensional state and action spaces where explicit policy engineering is infeasible, such as dynamic spectrum allocation, power control, and admission control \cite{ref4, ref8}.

By continuously learning from environmental interactions, DRL adapts resource management policies to fluctuating network conditions, often outperforming heuristic or static strategies. Notably, hybrid frameworks that integrate DRL with optimization techniques have demonstrated improved convergence rates and enhanced performance within resource-constrained environments—for example, federated learning (FL) systems characterized by heterogeneous wireless bandwidth \cite{ref50}. Embedding domain-specific knowledge into DRL architectures facilitates a better exploration-exploitation balance under real-time constraints.

Nonetheless, DRL introduces challenges including increased requirements for training data, concerns over interpretability, risks of overfitting, and indeterminacies in stability under non-stationary input distributions \cite{ref13}. Mitigation methods such as experience replay, target networks, and transfer learning help address these issues, but tuning the trade-off between model expressivity and computational tractability remains an active area of research.

\subsection{7.3 Challenges in Policy Design}

The design of RL policies for networking systems necessitates careful balancing of exploration and exploitation in environments marked by non-stationarity, such as wireless networks \cite{ref3, ref6, ref14, ref48}. While exploration is vital for discovering improved policies, it can negatively impact performance and increase latency—outcomes that are unacceptable in mission-critical or ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) applications. Conversely, over-reliance on exploitation may lead to suboptimal policies when network traffic or channel conditions evolve.

To address these competing demands, advanced techniques have been proposed, including adaptive exploration rates, uncertainty-aware policy learning, and reward shaping aligned to networking performance metrics. Low-latency inference requirements impose strict constraints on model size and motivate the employment of efficient state acquisition mechanisms. However, obtaining accurate state information remains challenging due to noisy measurements, delays, and partial observability common in distributed systems \cite{ref3}.

Robust state estimation strategies are therefore essential, often implemented via filtering techniques or through latent state representations learned end-to-end within RL algorithms. Furthermore, ensuring policy generalization across heterogeneous devices and diverse environments without compromising responsiveness calls for meta-RL and multi-agent RL frameworks \cite{ref14}.

\subsection{7.4 Federated and Distributed Reinforcement Learning}

Federated reinforcement learning (FRL) and distributed RL paradigms have become increasingly important in networking systems aiming to enhance privacy preservation, reduce computing load, and accelerate convergence within edge-cloud ecosystems \cite{ref49, ref50}. These approaches decentralize training processes, enabling multiple clients—such as base stations or edge devices—to collaboratively learn coherent policies without sharing raw data. This framework inherently supports privacy preservation and compliance with regulatory requirements.

Techniques such as gradient sparsification and adaptive client selection reduce communication overhead, which is critical in bandwidth-constrained wireless environments \cite{ref49}. Recent studies reveal that FRL can maintain robust policy performance despite client dropout and data heterogeneity by employing error-feedback mechanisms and weighted aggregation of client updates \cite{ref49}. Complementary resource allocation algorithms jointly optimize bandwidth and computation to speed up training convergence and improve accuracy in FL-based wireless networks \cite{ref50}.

Despite these advantages, challenges persist in synchronizing distributed RL agents, mitigating the impact of straggler clients, and defending against adversarial attacks. Future research directions emphasize asynchronous FRL algorithms, stronger privacy-preserving mechanisms such as differential privacy, and scalable architectures designed to accommodate the complexity anticipated in 6G wireless networks.

\subsection{7.5 Integration Across Networking Frameworks}

The efficacy of RL and adaptive control techniques is significantly amplified when integrated with complementary AI-driven networking frameworks, including network traffic classification, software-defined networking (SDN), and routing optimization \cite{ref51, ref52, ref53}. Deep learning-based traffic classification models provide granular insight into network flow characteristics, enabling RL controllers to optimize resource allocation by prioritizing traffic types effectively \cite{ref51}.

Within SDN architectures, RL-powered controllers dynamically adjust routing and admission control policies in response to real-time network state changes, thus enhancing throughput, reducing latency, and improving fault tolerance \cite{ref52}. Similarly, RL-based routing protocols adaptively select communication paths to balance load and mitigate both congestion and failures \cite{ref53}.

Such cross-framework synergies promote comprehensive network adaptation strategies where RL agents leverage enriched contextual information and explicit control channels afforded by SDN. However, integrating multiple AI modules introduces novel challenges, including interoperability complexities, elevated computational demands, and risks of cascading failures. Addressing these requires efforts towards standardization, modular AI pipelines, and the incorporation of explainable AI techniques to maintain transparency and manageability in autonomous network operations.

\subsection{8. Gradient-Based Optimization and Fast Algorithmic Updates}

#### 8.1 Gradient Descent and Variants

Gradient-based optimization constitutes a foundational approach for tuning control and network parameters in large-scale communication and data networks. Traditional gradient descent methods, alongside their accelerated variants, have proven effective for scalable optimization tasks. However, the challenges of high-dimensional uncertainty and the presence of integer decision variables significantly complicate these optimization processes. In particular, while continuous control parameters allow for convergence guarantees under smoothness assumptions, incorporating integer or mixed-integer variables markedly increases computational complexity and complicates theoretical convergence analyses \cite{ref36}. This challenge is exacerbated in settings characterized by large state spaces and expansive uncertainty sets, where computational demands grow exponentially with dimensionality.

To address scalability, recent algorithmic refinements such as stochastic gradient methods and adaptive learning rate schemes have been introduced. These techniques facilitate efficient updates of parameters even in vast and complex networks \cite{ref1,ref9,ref10,ref11,ref12,ref14,ref16}. However, the inherently discrete nature of some optimization variables often necessitates hybrid or relaxation-based approaches, balancing solution quality against computational tractability. The treatment of such integer-constrained optimization problems remains an active area for both theoretical development and practical algorithm design.

#### 8.2 Hybrid Model- and Data-Driven Gradient Approaches

In recognition of the limitations inherent to purely gradient-driven methods, recent research has advanced hybrid frameworks that integrate model-based insights with data-driven adaptations. These approaches capitalize on structural knowledge encoded within network models while concurrently exploiting real-time or historical data to inform adaptive gradient computations \cite{ref5,ref7,ref13}. This synergy enhances convergence speed and algorithmic flexibility by dynamically adjusting update rules and mitigating the discrepancies between modeled assumptions and evolving network conditions.

For example, in self-optimized wireless networks (SON), deep learning techniques have been combined with model-based control mechanisms to tune parameters robustly across diverse and variable environments \cite{ref1}. Such hybrid designs improve responsiveness and stability in network optimization, effectively addressing several of the scalability and convergence bottlenecks commonly encountered in complex, real-world systems.

#### 8.3 Fast Algorithmic Update Techniques

The imperative for rapid recalibration of control policies in dynamic and stochastic network environments has motivated the development of fast algorithmic update methods focused on minimizing computational latency. Speed is critical for enabling online learning and real-time control systems \cite{ref2,ref3,ref6,ref8,ref9,ref11,ref15,ref16}. Common techniques include incremental gradient updates, warm-starting solvers using previous solutions, and deploying approximation heuristics that, while computationally inexpensive, provide effective parameter updates.

Within telecommunication networks, these approaches allow systems to adapt promptly to abrupt changes in traffic patterns or channel conditions, thereby sustaining quality-of-service guarantees and enhancing resource allocation efficiency \cite{ref10}. Nonetheless, maintaining an appropriate balance between update speed and solution optimality is challenging: overly aggressive approximations can lead to suboptimal policy performance, whereas attempting exact updates may incur prohibitive computational delays. Algorithmic innovations that leverage parallel computation and distributed optimization are essential to navigating this trade-off, enabling methods to achieve both scalability and timely responsiveness.

#### 8.4 Case Studies and Benchmarks

Empirical validations of gradient-based optimization and fast update techniques within real-world telecommunication networks provide critical insight into their practical efficacy and constraints \cite{ref1,ref4,ref10,ref37,ref47}. Dynamic optimization strategies employing these methods have yielded measurable improvements in network throughput, latency reduction, and resource utilization across diverse scenarios.

Despite these gains, scalability remains a key limitation, especially for very large instances with high heterogeneity and complex constraints. Such challenges impede direct application of classical gradient-based methods and motivate the incorporation of hybrid metaheuristic approaches \cite{ref37}. Benchmark studies demonstrate that while gradient-driven frameworks effectively handle moderately sized networks, augmenting them with metaheuristics—such as variable neighborhood search or population-based heuristics—enhances solution quality and exploration capacity for large-scale combinatorial problems.

These findings highlight the value of modular algorithmic strategies that adaptively integrate gradient information with heuristic exploration, thereby balancing computational efficiency with solution robustness.

#### 8.5 Neural Network-Based Information Transfer (NNIT)

Addressing the dynamic and time-varying nature of network environments necessitates mechanisms that not only optimize current parameters but also systematically leverage historical knowledge to expedite future adaptations. Neural Network-Based Information Transfer (NNIT) exemplifies this approach by learning mappings between evolving network states and corresponding optimal or near-optimal solutions, thus facilitating accelerated convergence and improved adaptability \cite{ref38,ref39,ref40,ref47}.

NNIT architectures typically couple population-based evolutionary algorithms with neural networks trained to predict promising regions of the solution space. This integration enables effective transfer of information across sequential optimization tasks, substantially reducing computational overhead. Applications in supply chain decision frameworks—which bear similarity to telecommunications problems in terms of complexity and dynamics—exemplify the computational benefits derived from NNIT methods \cite{ref38}.

Moreover, the incorporation of interpretable AI within NNIT frameworks yields valuable insight into solution landscapes, enhancing transparency and fostering trust—critical factors for deployment in safety-critical and high-stakes network systems \cite{ref39}. Prospective extensions of NNIT to nonlinear stochastic decentralized adaptive controls further underscore its potential to address a broad spectrum of optimization challenges intrinsic to modern networked systems \cite{ref40}.

---

In summary, this section has delineated how gradient-based optimization techniques, when enriched by hybrid model-data-driven frameworks, rapid update strategies, and intelligent information transfer mechanisms such as NNIT, constitute a robust and versatile toolkit for tackling the profound complexity, scalability, and dynamism characteristic of contemporary and future network control tasks. Each method possesses unique advantages and faces specific challenges, motivating integrated algorithmic designs that exploit their complementary strengths to achieve superior optimization performance and adaptive capacity.

\section{AI-Enhanced Wireless Networking and Sensing}

\subsection{Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS)}

Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) have emerged as a transformative technology enabling programmable manipulation of wireless propagation environments. Unlike conventional wireless systems that treat the environment as a stochastic and uncontrollable factor, RIS impose deterministic control through engineered metasurfaces capable of dynamically altering incident electromagnetic waves. The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly machine learning techniques, significantly enhances RIS functionality by enabling adaptive optimization over complex, high-dimensional configuration spaces. Supervised learning methods facilitate channel estimation by mapping measured channel state information (CSI) to optimal RIS configurations, while unsupervised approaches enable feature extraction from unlabeled channel data, thereby improving generalization to dynamic environments. Moreover, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) provides an effective framework for sequential decision-making under uncertainty, enabling adaptive beamforming and resource allocation policies that maximize spectral efficiency and energy savings \cite{ref49}. The synergy of these AI paradigms empowers RIS to overcome challenges associated with nonlinear and time-varying wireless channels, ultimately achieving more robust and efficient wireless links.

\subsection{Benefits and Challenges of RIS}

The AI-enabled RIS paradigm offers multiple benefits. These include significantly enhanced spectral efficiency through improved directivity and interference management, augmented energy efficiency by reducing the reliance on active radio frequency components, and extension of coverage by enabling signal reflection and focusing beyond line-of-sight barriers. Consequently, RIS facilitates connectivity in dense urban or obstructed environments. Notably, its robustness under imperfect channel conditions stems from AI’s capacity to learn and compensate for noise and fading effects, thereby maintaining high communication quality \cite{ref49}.

Nevertheless, these advantages are accompanied by inherent challenges. The RIS configuration space is inherently high-dimensional, making exhaustive search or traditional heuristic optimization impractical. Addressing this complexity requires scalable AI algorithms capable of effective dimension reduction while preserving performance integrity. Additionally, RIS introduces security concerns, as adversaries could exploit RIS for unauthorized eavesdropping or signal manipulation. This risk necessitates the development of secure AI-driven configuration protocols alongside real-time anomaly detection mechanisms \cite{ref49}. Balancing these benefits and challenges is central to progressing RIS deployment in real-world wireless networks.

\subsection{Future Prospects in Wireless AI}

Looking forward, the deployment of lightweight distributed AI architectures promises real-time, energy-efficient RIS control compatible with pervasive wireless networks. Federated learning stands out as a pivotal methodology, enabling decentralized training of RIS optimization models across edge nodes while preserving data privacy and minimizing communication overhead. This approach is particularly crucial given the increasing heterogeneity of network topologies and the non-independent and identically distributed (non-i.i.d.) nature of data distributions. The synchronization of federated AI with emerging physical-layer technologies — such as millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications, massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) antenna arrays, and edge computing infrastructures — is expected to catalyze edge intelligence \cite{ref49}. These integrated systems will jointly optimize sensing, communication, and computation resources within stringent latency and energy constraints. To realize these advancements, algorithmic innovations must tackle trade-offs between model complexity, convergence speed, and robustness to channel estimation errors. Furthermore, emerging paradigms like neuromorphic computing and online continual learning hold potential to enhance adaptability within highly dynamic wireless environments.

\subsection{Intelligent Interference Management in Perceptive Mobile Networks (PMNs)}

Perceptive Mobile Networks (PMNs) exemplify the convergence of communication and sensing functionalities, where wireless infrastructure simultaneously supports data transmission and situational awareness. Effective interference management is critical due to the coexistence of sensing waveforms and communication signals sharing spectral and spatial resources. Recent developments have leveraged AI-empowered interference mitigation frameworks that exploit macro-diversity gains and coordinated beamforming strategies across multi-cell architectures \cite{ref48}. Deep learning-based interference prediction models utilize historical and real-time channel observations to forecast interference patterns, enabling proactive resource allocation that maximizes the sensing signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) without compromising communication quality. This dynamic resource allocation supports high detection probabilities for sensing while minimizing intra- and inter-cell interference, thus balancing dual operational objectives.

Despite these advancements, several challenges remain. These include maintaining low-latency inference for real-time adaptation, acquiring accurate channel state information under user mobility, and designing scalable cooperation schemes that avoid prohibitive signaling overhead \cite{ref48}. Addressing these issues is essential for mature PMN deployments that effectively harmonize sensing and communication functions.

\subsection{Achievements and Challenges}

AI-driven wireless sensing techniques have demonstrably enhanced detection probabilities and mitigated sensing interference, particularly through cooperative interference management strategies leveraging coordinated multipoint processing and macro-diversity \cite{ref41,ref42}. These improvements enable robust detection performance in dense and heterogeneous network environments characterized by significant interference and channel uncertainty. Furthermore, privacy preservation has emerged as a critical concern within networked sensing, since sensitive environmental or user data may be indirectly inferred through side-channel attacks in cooperative frameworks. Recent studies propose privacy-aware AI algorithms that integrate differential privacy techniques and federated learning to alleviate these risks without significant deterioration of sensing performance \cite{ref43}.

Robustness to heterogeneity in hardware capabilities, channel conditions, and user mobility patterns remains another outstanding challenge. Techniques incorporating model adaptation and transfer learning have shown promise in addressing such variability but require extensive validation in diverse real-world settings \cite{ref44,ref45}. Consequently, bridging the gap between theoretical AI frameworks and practical deployment necessitates continued research focused on scalable cooperation protocols, secure architectures, and self-tuning training paradigms that can operate reliably across heterogeneous wireless environments.

\bigskip

In summary, AI-enhanced wireless networking and sensing via RIS and intelligent interference management mark the advent of programmable, efficient, and context-aware wireless systems. This progress hinges on the intricate interplay of algorithmic sophistication—encompassing supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement, and federated learning—and physical-layer innovations. Collectively, these advances establish a rich interdisciplinary frontier poised to shape future wireless ecosystems \cite{ref41,ref42,ref43,ref44,ref45,ref48,ref49}.

\section{Explainability, Interpretability, and Trust in AI-Controlled Telecommunication Systems}

\subsection{Importance of Transparent AI Decision-Making}

The incorporation of artificial intelligence (AI) in adaptive telecommunication and control systems introduces an unprecedented level of complexity, making transparent decision-making an essential attribute to cultivate trust among stakeholders and ensure compliance with evolving regulatory frameworks. Transparency serves as a cornerstone for certifying that AI-driven actions conform to desired operational, ethical, and legal standards, particularly within critical infrastructure sectors such as telecommunications \cite{ref7,ref13}. The establishment of trust is inherently linked to the system’s ability to provide interpretable rationales behind its decisions, thus enabling operators to verify, audit, and justify automated processes \cite{ref15}. This transparency is crucial in highly dynamic and heterogeneous network environments, where AI models must continually adapt to varying contextual conditions without compromising reliability and safety \cite{ref48}. Additionally, emerging AI governance regulations emphasize explainability as a fundamental principle, compelling telecommunication systems to exhibit clarity in their decision logic and mitigate risks associated with opaque AI behavior \cite{ref50}. Consequently, transparent AI not only bolsters user confidence but also facilitates regulatory approvals and promotes the widespread adoption of AI-enhanced telecommunication technologies.

\subsection{Methods for Interpretability and Explainability}

Attaining interpretability within AI-driven telecommunication systems necessitates the integration of explainability mechanisms directly into core optimization and learning frameworks. Reinforcement learning (RL), a dominant paradigm for dynamic resource allocation and control, often poses challenges to transparency due to the complexity inherent in value function approximations and policy networks. Modern methodologies address this opacity through model-agnostic interpretability techniques and surrogate models that extract actionable insights from trained RL agents. These approaches clarify decision rationales by illuminating factors such as state-action value contributions and reward attributions \cite{ref3,ref5}. Embedding explainability frameworks within optimization algorithms further enhances understanding by elucidating solution trajectories and facilitating sensitivity analyses. This enables operators to comprehend how variations in system parameters influence resource management outcomes \cite{ref8,ref9}. Hybrid frameworks that couple deep learning with symbolic reasoning have been advanced to strike a balance between predictive performance and interpretability, thereby supporting effective human-in-the-loop validation \cite{ref12}. Moreover, attention mechanisms and gradient-based attribution techniques embedded in neural network architectures highlight key features that influence AI decisions across tasks like traffic management, fault diagnosis, and spectrum allocation \cite{ref14}. Collectively, these methods constitute a comprehensive toolset that mitigates the inherent opaqueness of sophisticated AI models, enhancing operational transparency while preserving system efficacy.

\subsection{Future Directions}

Looking forward, the evolution of explainable AI (XAI) within telecommunication and control systems is poised to tackle current limitations and emerging challenges through several pivotal advancements. A primary focus lies in the development of privacy-preserving XAI techniques that reconcile the need for transparency with strict data confidentiality requirements prevalent in telecommunication networks \cite{ref48}. Federated explainability exemplifies such approaches by enabling interpretability without centralizing sensitive data, thereby aligning with privacy regulations and operational constraints. Additionally, enhancing interpretability frameworks to be resilient against adversarial manipulation is imperative, as opaque AI systems are vulnerable to exploitation in hostile environments, jeopardizing network security and reliability \cite{ref50}. Robust XAI methodologies must integrate anomaly detection and adversarial robustness to protect explanations from malicious interference \cite{ref54}. Furthermore, scaling explainability to accommodate large-scale communication and control architectures—which span cloud, edge, and device layers as well as multi-agent systems—demands modular, hierarchical interpretation mechanisms capable of contextualizing AI decisions across multiple abstraction levels \cite{ref55}. Cutting-edge AI paradigms such as multi-agent reinforcement learning and large language model-driven network intelligence require innovative explainability frameworks that capture complex cross-agent interactions and provide natural language interpretability, respectively. The integration of these approaches will ultimately reinforce trustworthiness, enhance operational safety, and ensure regulatory compliance for AI-controlled telecommunication systems amid escalating complexity and heterogeneity.

\subsection{11. Applications in Telecommunications and Networking}

#### 11.1. AI-Driven Adaptive Control Applications

The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, particularly machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), has substantially transformed adaptive control mechanisms in telecommunications networks. These advancements have empowered functions such as dynamic resource allocation, congestion management, fault tolerance, and traffic prediction. Deep learning architectures—including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and generative adversarial networks (GANs)—exhibit remarkable capabilities in extracting complex spatial-temporal patterns from network data, thereby improving both predictive accuracy and control responsiveness \cite{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,10,11,14,50}.

This progress reflects a paradigmatic shift from traditional static, heuristic-based methods toward data-driven adaptive frameworks, capable of learning from extensive historical and real-time network states. Reinforcement learning (RL), for instance, has been effectively applied to dynamic radio resource allocation, optimizing trade-offs between throughput and latency in heterogeneous wireless environments \cite{1,7}. Deep learning models such as CNNs and RNNs have demonstrated superior performance in traffic prediction by leveraging nonlinear dependencies and temporal correlations within network flows, outperforming classical statistical predictors \cite{2,3,5}. Additionally, GANs are instrumental in synthetic data generation and anomaly detection, thereby enhancing network fault management through identification of rare events and coping with sparse failure data \cite{6,10}.

Nonetheless, deploying these sophisticated models entails significant challenges. The computational overhead associated with training complex deep learning models can impede real-time application, particularly in large-scale or resource-constrained edge environments \cite{4,5}. Moreover, generalization remains a critical issue, as models must adapt continuously to heterogeneous and evolving network conditions, requiring efficient retraining or adaptation mechanisms \cite{7}. Privacy concerns, arising from the collection and processing of extensive network data, drive the adoption of privacy-preserving learning frameworks such as federated learning \cite{10,11}. Despite these challenges, AI-driven adaptive control substantially enhances network self-optimization, reducing operational expenditures while improving quality of service (QoS) \cite{14,50}.

#### 11.2. Evaluation Metrics and Benchmarking

Comprehensive evaluation of adaptive algorithms in realistic communication and wireless scenarios necessitates metrics that integrate both classical network performance and AI-specific qualities, including robustness and semantic fidelity. Traditional benchmarks—such as throughput, latency, packet loss, and bit error rate (BER)—remain fundamental indicators of network health \cite{3,5}. However, the emergence of semantic communications emphasizes the need for novel metrics that transcend bit-level correctness by quantifying the semantic integrity of transmitted data.

In this context, semantic similarity metrics (e.g., BLEU scores when applied to textual or annotated image data) have been proposed to assess the fidelity of content following AI-enhanced compression and error correction schemes \cite{1,3,50}. Incorporating these metrics addresses the inadequacies of strictly physical-layer evaluations, realigning optimization objectives with end-user perceived quality. Furthermore, adaptive algorithms are evaluated with respect to computational efficiency, convergence speed, and resilience to adversarial perturbations or network faults \cite{5,7,10}.

Despite these advancements, standardized benchmarks leveraging established datasets and simulation frameworks remain sparse, impeding cross-comparison and reproducibility. This landscape highlights an urgent need for comprehensive evaluation frameworks that synergize physical, semantic, and operational performance measures, thereby establishing uniform criteria for assessing AI-driven network control across diverse wireless and edge-cloud environments \cite{50}.

#### 11.3. Edge and Cloud Synergistic AI Solutions

The exponential growth of network data and the imperative for ultra-low-latency services have precipitated architectures that synergistically combine edge computing with cloud intelligence. By partitioning AI workloads between decentralized edge nodes and centralized cloud platforms, such hybrid frameworks optimize latency constraints while leveraging substantial computational resources to enhance network intelligence and robustness \cite{8,9,13,16,49,50}.

At the edge, AI models conduct real-time inference and process local data, which is critical for latency-sensitive applications including tactile internet and autonomous vehicle control. To accommodate resource limitations inherent to edge devices, lightweight deep learning models or compressed representations are employed \cite{8,13}. Concurrently, cloud-based AI systems aggregate global network insights, handle extensive training tasks, and disseminate updated models back to the edge, facilitating continuous learning and adaptive responsiveness \cite{9,16}.

Federated learning exemplifies this edge-cloud synergy by enabling decentralized model training across heterogeneous devices without compromising data privacy or incurring prohibitive communication overhead \cite{10}. However, this approach faces challenges such as device heterogeneity, fluctuating wireless channel conditions, and synchronization complexities, which can impair model convergence and necessitate sophisticated resource allocation strategies that jointly optimize computation and communication \cite{9,10}.

In addition, distributed AI architectures grapple with security vulnerabilities including adversarial attacks and data poisoning, prompting research into robust model design and trustworthy deployment at scale \cite{49,50}. Hence, the interplay between edge and cloud computing represents a crucial frontier for achieving intelligent, responsive, and secure network control in next-generation wireless systems.

#### 11.4. Resilient Control of Cyber-Physical Systems

Cyber-physical systems (CPS) underpinning telecommunications infrastructure demand resilient control strategies to maintain reliable operation in the presence of actuator faults and cyber attacks. Neural network-based finite-time resilient control methodologies, employing radial basis function neural networks (RBFNNs), observer designs, and Lyapunov–Krasovskii functionals, have demonstrated notable effectiveness in this domain \cite{46}.

This approach approximates unknown nonlinear dynamics and fault signals in nonlinear time-delay system models using RBFNNs, with parameters adapting online to uncertainties and disturbances. Simultaneously, observers estimate system states and fault signatures even amidst false data injection or measurement inconsistencies, thereby enhancing fault detection and isolation capabilities \cite{46}. The adaptive control laws integrate these estimates to guarantee finite-time convergence of both system states and estimation errors, significantly outperforming traditional asymptotic control schemes in terms of speed and robustness.

The synergy of adaptive neural control, observer design, and robust stability theory establishes a foundational paradigm for CPS resilience by coupling real-time fault diagnosis with control input adjustments to mitigate effects of component degradation and malicious interventions. Remaining challenges include extending these methods to systems with stochastic uncertainties, accommodating multiple actuator and sensor configurations, and conducting hardware-in-the-loop validations that mirror practical operational constraints \cite{46}.

#### 11.5. Open Research Frontiers

Emerging research trajectories in telecommunications emphasize multi-agent systems, stochastic modeling, and hardware-in-the-loop simulation platforms as pivotal frontiers advancing adaptive control and AI integration \cite{46}. Multi-agent frameworks foster scalable, decentralized decision-making across heterogeneous network entities, enhancing robustness and adaptability in complex, dynamic environments. The incorporation of stochastic models better captures wireless channel variability, environmental uncertainties, and human-in-the-loop behaviors, thereby necessitating adaptive control methodologies that judiciously balance performance against risk \cite{46}.

Hardware-in-the-loop platforms constitute indispensable testbeds that bridge algorithmic development and realistic hardware constraints, including timing delays, sensor inaccuracies, and communication limitations. These platforms facilitate expeditious prototyping, validation, and fine-tuning of resilient control schemes under conditions closely emulating actual network environments \cite{46}.

Complementary research efforts are focused on explainable AI paradigms for network control to ensure transparency and interpretability, and on integrating reinforcement learning with classical control theory to combine long-term policy optimization with guaranteed stability \cite{50}. Addressing computational complexity via model compression, distributed AI frameworks, and energy-aware algorithms remains critical, especially for deployment at the resource-constrained edge \cite{49}. Collectively, these avenues herald transformative potential for next-generation telecommunications systems that are intelligent, autonomous, and resilient.

\section{Cross-Cutting Themes and Integration Considerations}

\subsection{Scalability and Real-Time AI Inference}

The deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) within telecommunications demands scalable solutions capable of real-time inference across heterogeneous and dynamically evolving network environments. This requirement is challenging due to the high computational complexity of contemporary AI models, such as deep neural networks and large language models (LLMs), coupled with the variability of network resources and stringent latency constraints \cite{ref7,ref49,ref52,ref53}. For example, incorporating AI into Open RAN architectures mandates efficient processing pipelines that adhere to tight timing budgets, enabling rapid control loop adaptations critical for tasks like spectrum management and interference mitigation \cite{ref48}. Edge-cloud collaborative frameworks offer advantages by distributing AI inference workloads to optimize latency and computational resource utilization; however, they face scalability limitations, particularly when coordinating multiple edge nodes or base stations \cite{ref49}. Consequently, scalable AI architectures must integrate algorithmic compression techniques, model pruning, and hardware acceleration, as well as embrace modular and parallel design principles. Nevertheless, challenges such as synchronization and consistent model updating—especially within federated or distributed learning approaches—pose significant hurdles to maintaining real-time performance \cite{ref52}. Addressing these complexities is particularly vital for applications such as perceptive mobile networks (PMNs), where AI-driven interference management and sensing need to dynamically adapt to fluctuating load conditions without degrading communication quality \cite{ref53}.

\subsection{Privacy Preservation Strategies}

Preserving privacy is a critical concern in telecommunications due to the sensitive nature of transmitted data and strict regulatory frameworks. Prominent strategies for privacy preservation include federated learning, edge computing, and lightweight distributed AI methods that localize data processing, thereby reducing exposure risks \cite{ref48,ref49,ref50,ref52}. Federated learning facilitates collaborative model training across decentralized entities while keeping raw data on-site, effectively mitigating the risks inherent in centralized data collection \cite{ref49}. However, federated approaches encounter challenges such as communication overhead, heterogeneity of client devices, and susceptibility to inference attacks. Edge computing complements these methods by executing inference near data sources, which diminishes both privacy attack surfaces and communication latency \cite{ref52}. Moreover, deploying lightweight AI models at the edge—via techniques such as quantization and knowledge distillation—further enhances privacy protection alongside computational efficiency \cite{ref50}. Balancing privacy and model utility remains complex, demanding rigorously designed algorithms that integrate encryption, differential privacy, and robustness against adversarial threats. Furthermore, the rapid evolution of AI within open, multi-vendor ecosystems underscores the necessity for standardized frameworks embedding stringent privacy safeguards while maintaining interoperability \cite{ref48,ref52}.

\subsection{Explainability and Trust}

Establishing trust and transparency in AI-driven telecommunications systems is essential, given that automated decisions directly affect service quality and network reliability \cite{ref7,ref48,ref50,ref54}. Explainability techniques empower operators and stakeholders to interpret AI decision-making processes, identify erroneous outputs, and align these decisions with domain expertise. For instance, incorporating explainable AI in network management systems clarifies the rationale for resource allocation or anomaly detection outcomes, thereby fostering confidence and enabling effective human-in-the-loop oversight \cite{ref7}. Nonetheless, the predominant use of complex deep learning models often results in opaque, black-box systems, presenting a fundamental trade-off between prediction accuracy and interpretability \cite{ref54}. Research efforts towards inherently interpretable models and post hoc explanation methods—such as attention visualization, feature attribution, and counterfactual reasoning—are making progress but are not yet fully matured for comprehensive telecom application \cite{ref50}. Additionally, explainability is indispensable for regulatory compliance verification and mitigating risks from erroneous AI decisions, which may otherwise propagate cascading network failures \cite{ref48}. Therefore, enhancing the transparency of AI systems remains a vital challenge to foster systemic trust and ensure responsible deployment.

\subsection{Interoperability and Standardization Challenges}

The integration of AI into telecommunications networks contends with significant interoperability and standardization obstacles due to diverse multi-vendor equipment, heterogeneous protocol stacks, and disparate technology domains \cite{ref48,ref52,ref54}. Fragmented AI models and incompatible data schemas disrupt seamless AI-driven control coordination across Open RAN components, including radio units (RU), distributed units (DU), and centralized units (CU) \cite{ref48}. The absence of unified AI interfaces and standardized telemetry data formats impedes the implementation of distributed intelligence and federated learning, limiting scalability and hindering cross-vendor collaboration \cite{ref52}. Moreover, divergent regulatory requirements and privacy policies exacerbate fragmentation in AI adoption among various jurisdictions and operators. Though early-stage efforts by standardization bodies aim to define AI protocols and data representations, these remain nascent but are imperative for enabling plug-and-play AI modules and guaranteeing reproducible, reliable AI-enhanced network functions \cite{ref54}. Closing these interoperability gaps necessitates interdisciplinary initiatives to harmonize software stacks, unify data semantics, and develop AI models resilient to domain shifts inherent in multi-technology ecosystems.

\subsection{Security and Robustness}

As AI technologies permeate critical telecommunications infrastructure, ensuring security and robustness against adversarial threats, data poisoning, and erroneous model outputs is fundamental to operational reliability \cite{ref48,ref50,ref55}. AI models are vulnerable to attacks exploiting weaknesses in training data, model parameters, and inference processes, potentially resulting in misclassifications, compromised routing decisions, or degradation of service quality. Such attacks are especially harmful in complex AI-enabled networks where flawed decisions may cascade, causing widespread disruptions across multiple layers and services \cite{ref50}. Defensive strategies include adversarial training, development of robust model architectures, sophisticated anomaly detection systems, and hierarchical control mechanisms equipped with fallback options to mitigate AI failures \cite{ref55}. Additionally, integrating explainability aids in the early detection of abnormal AI behaviors, while federated learning frameworks can minimize insider threats by limiting data exposure \cite{ref48}. Nonetheless, achieving security without compromising performance or scalability remains challenging, particularly within resource-constrained edge environments typical in 5G and subsequent network generations \cite{ref55}. Therefore, designing AI systems with intrinsic robustness, continuous validation processes, and adaptive security measures is imperative for their trustworthy integration into future telecommunication infrastructures.
