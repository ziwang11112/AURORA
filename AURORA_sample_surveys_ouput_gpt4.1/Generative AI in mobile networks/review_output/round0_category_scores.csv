gpt-4.1,Pages 1–3,0,Literature,Comprehensiveness,5,"The survey references a wide range of literature (many citations, several referenced with grouped citations), indicating comprehensive coverage. There is discussion on the strengths and limitations/weaknesses of existing approaches, though a direct comparison of perspectives is not always explicit in this section. Almost all references are recent and relevant, with mentions of references up through the past two or three years. The list is slightly generic in specific spots with grouped references, though this does not substantially affect overall comprehensiveness."
