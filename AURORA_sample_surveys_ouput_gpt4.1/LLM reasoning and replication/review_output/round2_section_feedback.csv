claude-3.7,Pages 31–33,"11.6 Strategic Recommendations for the Field, 12 Conclusion, and Summary Sections","Articulates a comprehensive and clearly structured set of strategic recommendations for the field, mapped to persistent gaps.; Presents a holistic, multifaceted roadmap including benchmarking, modularity, transparency, and FAIR/open science.; Conclusion and summary sections restate objectives, synthesize findings, and identify research gaps and debates.; Highlights a novel conceptual taxonomy/framework, evidenced by both text and summarizing tables.; Interweaves theoretical analysis, actionable advice, and explicit cross-disciplinary orientation.; Professional academic tone, strong logical structure, and effective use of summary tables (e.g., Table 18).; Extensive, up-to-date, and appropriately cited literature; clear identification of field-wide challenges and forward-looking recommendations.",,"Maintain the level of granularity and actionability in recommendations in future revisions.; If possible, include direct examples or brief case studies in the roadmap to further illustrate impact.; Continue standardizing section headings and clear terminology for accessibility, especially for interdisciplinary audiences."
gpt-4.1,Pages 34–36,"Summary, Recommendations, and Pillars for Trustworthy LLM/Foundation Model Research","Explicit articulation of persistent research gaps and actionable recommendations.; Thorough, up-to-date literature coverage, including both recent benchmarks and contrasting survey opinions.; Introduction and summary of 'five pillars' for robust research, offering conceptual clarity.; Effective use of summary tables (Table 19 and Table 20) to synthesize content.",Minor formatting issues: occasional visual/text artifact from repeated conference footer.; Section boundaries between tabular summaries and main narrative could be clearer.; Visual materials are limited to tables—an accompanying conceptual diagram could enhance clarity of pillar relationships.,Refine section transitions and clarify where summaries/tables end and main analysis resumes.; Consider adding a visual diagram illustrating the interaction among the five pillars.; Address small formatting artifacts for a smoother reading experience.
gemini-2.5,Pages 34–36,Conclusion/Pillars and Recommendations,"Synthesizes persistent gaps, recommendations, and future directions in a structured manner.; Presents a clear and actionable five-pillar conceptual framework for trustworthy foundation model research.; Uses highly relevant, recent, and comprehensive references.; Tables provide effective summarization and easy comparison.; Strong academic tone and organization.","Objectives are not explicitly stated in this section; more of a summative synthesis.; The detailed analysis is moderately deep, but largely at a synthesis/summary level rather than offering truly novel theoretical insight.; Visual support is limited to tables; richer figures or workflow diagrams could further improve comprehensibility.; Section headings could be labeled more explicitly for improved rapid navigation.","Wherever possible, reiterate the explicit objectives in major summary sections to aid stand-alone clarity.; Consider integrating one or more conceptual/architectural diagrams (beyond tables) to visually represent the pillar framework or workflow.; Continue to emphasize balance in strengths/weakness critique, and where citing alternative/competing surveys, expand briefly on points of contention or consensus.; Ensure all section transitions and headings remain as explicit as possible for easier reference."
claude-3.7,Pages 34–36,"Summary, Recommendations, and Pillars (Tables 19 & 20)","Comprehensive, up-to-date citation list with broad, multi-perspective coverage.; Actionable mapping of persistent gaps, recommendations, and foundational pillars.; Highlights interplay between explainability, reproducibility, and responsibility.; Effective use of summary tables to crystallize complex relationships.; Integrates evidence from competing frameworks and benchmarks.",Objectives are more implied than explicitly stated/measurable.; Section heading structure and contextual framing could be clearer for standalone reading.; Discussion of analysis is somewhat descriptive and could further elaborate causes or tradeoffs.,"Explicitly restate objectives or connect the pillar/recommendation synthesis to initial goals.; Use clearer sub-section headings for recommendations and summary tables.; Expand commentary on tradeoffs, and provide more concrete examples or case studies illustrating persistent gaps."
gpt-4.1,Pages 37–37,References,"Very comprehensive with a high volume of up-to-date citations including 2024–2025 works.; References cover a wide range of recent core literature in AI, especially LLMs and foundation models.; Generally correct formatting with DOIs and URLs provided for traceability.","A few references contain minor formatting inconsistencies (e.g., broken lines, some punctuation issues).; Balance and discussion of references cannot be determined from this section alone, as this is a bibliography without narrative.","Check the final document for line breaks and consistency in reference formatting.; Ensure all entries follow a unified citation style (punctuation, DOIs)."
gemini-2.5,Pages 37–37,References,"Very comprehensive and up-to-date citation list, covering key and recent literatures in language models, benchmarking, reasoning, and evaluation.; Strong inclusion of both journal and major conference works, preprints, and a variety of domains.","Minor formatting inconsistencies (line wraps, truncated entries).; No narrative or analysis—literature balance and synthesis cannot be assessed here.","Review for formatting consistency, especially at end-of-lines and citation truncations.; Ensure every citation is complete and traceable (one entry appears truncated)."
