claude-3.7,Pages 31–33,References,"Extremely comprehensive and current bibliography.; Includes over 100 references from diverse subfields: clustering, high-dimensional data, indexing, data structures, outlier detection, trajectory search, and more.; Coverage includes recent years (2022–2025) and preprints, showing attention to current developments.; Provides a valuable resource for researchers seeking foundational and state-of-the-art works.","As a reference list, it contains no synthesis, summarization, or analysis.; There is no explicit discussion of relevance, objectives, or audience for this section alone.; No visual summaries, tables, or section headings beyond the citation sequence.; No identification or discussion of research gaps, balance among perspectives, or integration of literature.","In the main text, ensure strong linkage to these references through integrative narrative and synthesis.; Consider adding brief annotations to key references in main sections or as an appendix to highlight seminal works.; Highlight especially foundational or recent paradigm-shifting papers (with asterisks or categorization) if possible in future versions.; Ensure continued currency by updating to include any new influential works before final publication."
