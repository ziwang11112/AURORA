Recognizing that most existing research treats interoperable machine communication and adaptive manufacturing control as separate problems, the authors integrate semantic communicationfacilitated by dynamic Machine Graphs containing machine capability, availability, and learned allocation preferencesdirectly into the learning process of a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) system. By representing machine-agent information and job-allocation histories in a knowledge graph, the RL agents benefit from domain-specific knowledge, which constrains their search space and accelerates convergence.

The authors propose a graph-based multi-agent system (GMAS) leveraging a centralized-learning decentralized-execution (CLDE) approach underpinned by Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), allowing efficient extraction of global coordination features from unstructured data arising in multi-agent interactions. FJSP is modeled using a probabilistic Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), enabling flexible, consecutive scheduling aligned with the versatile functions of CNC machines and the requirements for small-batch or personalized production. The GMAS architecture includes environment, job agent, and machine agent modules, wherein job agents interact with machine agents and the environment in a decentralized manner, while GCN-extracted features inform centralized learning for global optimization. The scheduling strategy is formalized as a probability distribution over edge connections in the DAG, with optimization guided by a combination of expected makespan and machine load rates. Simulations on benchmark datasets (Brandimarte and Hurink) across various dynamic scenarios demonstrate that GMAS outperforms state-of-the-art rivals, offering superior makespan, robustness, adaptability, and scalability; it achieves the lowest CPU utilization (ACU) and data occupation (ADO) as complexity increases. Improved queuing rules further enhance machine utilization.

The framework comprises three core blocks: resource integration (distinguishing VRIN and nonVRIN resources), organizational capabilities (conceptualized at two levels), and expected outcomes, highlighting the mediating and moderating roles of digital technology. Five key theoretical propositions are articulated: (1) both VRIN and nonVRIN resources positively affect higher-order capabilities; (2) digital technology moderates these associations; (3) higher-order capabilities facilitate lower-order capabilities, which in turn drive firm performance. The model positions digital transformation as a process of systematic resource reconfiguration and capability development rather than mere technology adoption.

Vibration signals were reduced in dimensionality with principal component analysis (PCA) and decomposed into intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) via empirical mode decomposition (EMD), from which both statistical (\textit{e.g.}, RMS, peak-to-peak, mean, STD) and sweeping-frequency features were extracted in time and frequency domains. These features, alongside cutting parameters, were input into separate long short-term memory (LSTM) networks to estimate the corresponding IMFs of the surface profiles. Correlation analyses revealed that selected features, particularly those related to even multiples of the spindle speed (due to the tools two-flute geometry), significantly improved prediction performance. Experimental results with 168 datasets showed accurate prediction of mid- to low-frequency surface profile components, with mean absolute percentage errors (MAPE) of 14.72% for IMF-5 to IMF-12 and 7.79% for IMF-8 to IMF-12, while total surface profiles reached an overall MAPE of 24.17%.

For a cylinder, the relevant rules are: (1) the EDGE_CURVE pattern must be circle-line-circle-line (or reversed), (2) the radii of all circles match the cylinder's radius, (3) the X and Z coordinates of the cylinder's circular faces must be equal while Y coordinates differ, and (4) surface type must be CYLINDRICAL_SURFACE.

The methodology involves leveraging synthetic data, applying Virtual OMA to simulations, and Real OMA to physical machine measurements, with domain adaptation techniques (like Transfer Component Analysis and auxiliary data injection) bridging the gap between simulation and experiment.

Available: https://ojmo.centre-mersenne.org/articles/10.5802/ojmo.21/ doi:10.5802/ojmo.21","Frank and Wolfes conditional gradient (FrankWolfe) method is a classical algorithm for smooth constrained optimization, particularly effective when linear minimization over the feasible set is computationally efficient. However, its performance is questionable for nonsmooth problems, where it may fail to reach a stationary point. This paper demonstrates that the FrankWolfe algorithm can be employed to compute Clarke-stationary points for nonconvex and nonsmooth problems characterized by upper-$C^{1,\alpha}$ objective functions minimized over convex and compact sets. Additionally, under stronger assumptions, the author introduces an algorithmic variant that attains higher-order stationarity, specifically directional stationarity and, in certain cases, local optimality."

Available: https://www.nature.com/articles/s42004-021-00550-x","The paper presents a fully autonomous, closed-loop system for process optimization in chemical synthesis, specifically demonstrated on a stereoselective SuzukiMiyaura coupling. By integrating off-the-shelf robotics, machine learning (ML) algorithms (Phoenics, Gryffin), and seamless data transfer, the system autonomously explores both categorical (phosphine ligand) and continuous process variables to maximize product yield. A key innovation is the unbiased, systematic selection of ligands using k-means clustering on molecular descriptors derived from DFT calculations, as opposed to tradition-based human intuition. Autonomous closed-loop optimization using this strategy led to higher and more selective yields for the desired isomer ($73\%$, $2.5:1$ E/Z) compared to intuition-driven ligand selection. The workflow required minimal hardware customization and achieved robust reproducibility ($\sim1$2 mol% SD, 68% RSD). While adding molecular descriptors as direct input features had limited effect on ligand discovery, post-experiment modeling proposed further promising ligands that human experts had missed. The approach accelerated optimization, addressed experimenter bias, and suggests that data-driven, algorithmic planning can outperform traditional experimental design and intuition in complex, multidimensional chemical optimization problems. Future directions include improved process-constrained parallel algorithms, greater data interpretability, and refined parameterization to empower chemists with insights learned by the system."

When per-unit energy savings are deterministic (DU scenario), the analysis derives optimal strategies for both manufacturers and energy service companies (ESCOs) under self-saving and shared savings models, showing that CEA consistently increases optimal savings and profits but does not necessarily influence the optimal choice between energy-saving modes. In the case where savings are stochastic (UU scenario) and guaranteed savings are introduced, optimal strategies largely mirror those found in the deterministic case. These findings are validated through numerical studies demonstrating the results significance."

[Online]. Available: https://doi.org/10.1080/00207543.2019.1627311","This paper addresses the optimal design of machining processes involving ordered operations, many of which may be mandatory, optional, nested, and potentially intersecting due to modern multi-tool capabilities. The authors highlight that intersecting sets of operationsarising from overlapping tool paths or concurrent setupsrequire careful aggregation into executable blocks, each with adjustable execution rates, in order to minimize total production time and cost under real-world process constraints (such as rigidity, collision avoidance, energy, and tool wear). The approach systematically models the process as a partially ordered set, encodes technological dependencies and intersections, and formulates a constrained optimization problem. For processes where intersections form a tree structure, a polynomial-time dynamic programming algorithm is described, while more general intersection graphs necessitate heuristics due to NP-hardness. Experiments, including an industrial case, reveal the method can reduce total machining time by 30% relative to naive approaches, with near-optimality (within 27% of the lower bound) for larger, complex instances. The discussion notes both practical advantages and limitationsespecially for highly complex intersection topologiesand outlines future directions such as advanced heuristics, predictive wear integration, and CAM system compatibility. Overall, this work provides a scalable framework for aggregate block formation and rate selection in multi-operation machining, validated by computational experiments and real-world case studies."

Analyzing a sample of 87 US treatment firms that have adopted VRMPs and 87 matched control firms without such adoption over the period of 20102020, our difference-in-differences estimation suggests that the treatment firms gain more production efficiency improvement when compared with the matched control firms. We also find that the production efficiency improvement arising from VRMPs is more pronounced for firms facing high levels of labor volatility and market dynamism. Our additional analysis further suggests that applying VR technologies into different manufacturing stages and in different industrial sectors can result in different degrees of production efficiency improvement. Overall, our study demonstrates the positive effect of VRMPs on production efficiency but also reveals how the effect can vary across firms depending on their operating environments, VR application fields, and industrial sectors."

Using 28 interviews across six sectors (aerospace, automotive, electronics, energy, healthcare, machinery) in four countries, the authors find that AM enables exploratory learning (boosting resilience through rapid redesign, digital inventory, and flexible networks) and exploitative learning (driving efficiency via localized, on-demand production and resource savings). Four propositions emerge: (1) AM enhances resilience via exploratory learning; (2) AM improves efficiency via exploitative learning; (3) balancing both learning modes with AM leads to greater supply chain ambidexterity; and (4) digital integration with platforms (IoT, cloud) amplifies these effects. Barriers include high investment, lack of standards, IP concerns, integration challenges, and skills gaps. The study concludes that AM's true value arises when it is purposefully integrated into digital supply chain strategies, overcoming the traditional resilience-efficiency trade-off and positioning AM as a core capability for navigating ongoing disruptions."

This study, grounded in the natural resource-based view, investigates how digital investment influences environmental performance via the mediating effects of production efficiency and green innovation. Analyzing data from 273 Chinese pollution-intensive firms (totaling 1009 firm-year observations between 2016 and 2020), the research demonstrates that digital investment significantly improves environmental performance, with both production efficiency and green innovation serving as partial mediators. Notably, heterogeneity analysis reveals this positive impact is significant only in state-owned and heavy industrial firmsnot in private or light industrial firms. Moreover, the environmental benefits in heavy industrial firms stem from improved efficiency, while in state-owned firms, both efficiency and innovation mediate the effect. These findings provide actionable insights for managers and policymakers seeking to leverage digital investments for sustainable industrial development in the Industry 4.0 era."

After establishing the importance of productivitydescribed by Paul Krugman as almost everything in long-run economic developmentthe paper surveys a wide spectrum of productivity measurement methods, from simple indexes to sophisticated tools like the Malmquist Productivity Index (MPI), including their decomposition into efficiency and technological change components. Key analytical approaches covered include growth accounting, various index number theories (Laspeyres, Paasche, Fisher, Tornqvist), and efficiency measurement techniques such as Data Envelopment Analysis and Stochastic Frontier Analysis. The discussion highlights both theoretical developments and empirical illustrations, emphasizing advances made by Rolf Fare and Shawna Grosskopf, as well as statistical properties and inference methods relevant to MPI. Table-based bibliometric analysis is used to visualize the fields evolution. The article also critically examines the inherent challenges of productivity measurementsuch as aggregation methods, restrictive assumptions like Hicks-neutrality and constant returns to scale, and empirical inference issueswhile acknowledging the influence of data choices on conclusions about productivity trends. Future directions point toward unifying disparate methodologies, merging with causal inference and artificial intelligence, and integrating big data and real-time tools to support robust productivity analysis.

Available: https://doi.org/10.1007/s11123-023-00661-8","This paper proposes a new method to improve the finite sample approximation of central limit theorems (CLTs) for aggregates of data envelopment analysis (DEA) efficiency estimators, which are widely used for measuring efficiency in settings such as banks or hospitals. Recognizing that previous CLT-based confidence intervals tended to undercover true values in small sample or high-dimensional cases, the authors suggest estimating the variance using bias-corrected individual efficiency estimates ($\hat{\lambda}_i - \hat{B}_i$) instead of uncorrected estimates. The key equations are: the sample variance estimate used in Kneip et al. (2015) ($\hat{\sigma}^2 = n^{-1} \sum_{i=1}^n (\hat{\lambda}_i - n^{-1} \sum_{i=1}^n \hat{\lambda}_i)^2$), the partial variance correction by Simar \& Zelenyuk (2020) ($\tilde{\sigma}^2 = \hat{\sigma}^2 + \hat{B}^2$), and the new full variance correction ($\hat{\hat{\sigma}}^2 = n^{-1} \sum_{i=1}^n [ (\hat{\lambda}_i - \hat{B}_i) - n^{-1} \sum_{i=1}^n (\hat{\lambda}_i - \hat{B}_i)]^2$). Extensive Monte Carlo simulations show that, especially for small samples ($n\leq100$) and higher dimensions, this new method, particularly when combined with the 'data sharpening' approach, yields empirical coverage very close to nominal confidence levels (e.g., for $n=100, p=3, q=1$, coverage improves from 0.694 to 0.954). For the free disposal hull (FDH) estimator, the improvements are even more pronounced. The method requires no additional computational cost and keeps the asymptotic properties intact. Some overshooting (empirical coverage > nominal) may occur, but is safer than under-coverage, and for large sample sizes all methods become asymptotically equivalent. The authors note that further research could address residual first-order error terms and extend methods to other efficiency measures."
