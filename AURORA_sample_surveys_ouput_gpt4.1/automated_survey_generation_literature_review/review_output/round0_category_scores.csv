gpt-4.1,Pages 1–3,0,Literature,Comprehensiveness,5,"The paper demonstrates extensive citation (~30+ refs indicated in section), covers multiple subfields, and touches competing methods. Some citations are clustered ([20,76,110,...])—full bibliographic accuracy can't be confirmed from these pages alone, but no major omissions are evident. Discussion addresses both strengths and weaknesses (e.g., benefits and open challenges). Recent references are apparent, including some up to 2025, but a few areas rely on slightly older standards (PRISMA, AMSTAR-2, etc.)."
