gemini-2.5,Pages 34–36,Conclusion and References,"Provides a strong summary emphasizing the interdisciplinary evolution and future directions in fractal geometry and self-similar structures.; Highlights open challenges and synthesizes current frontiers across analysis, geometry, physics, and computational sciences.; Exceedingly comprehensive, current, and multidisciplinary reference section.","Explicit objectives for this section are not clearly stated, relying on synthesis rather than direct aims.; Section headings are not well demarcated (e.g., conclusion versus references).; No visuals, tables, or summary diagrams to reinforce key takeaways; synthesis in prose only.; Some references are duplicated in the bibliography, which may cause confusion.","Clarify the distinct boundaries between conclusion, summary, and references (e.g., via explicit section headings).; Include brief summary tables or diagrams that highlight research gaps and future challenges.; Reduce duplicated references; present a single comprehensive bibliography instead of repetition.; If possible, more explicitly state the measurable objectives/goals for the synthesis presented in the conclusion."
claude-3.7,Pages 34–36,Conclusion and References,"Extremely wide-ranging, up-to-date reference list covering all facets of the field.; Synthesis underscores unresolved challenges and opportunities for integration across analysis, topology, quantum theory, and computational methods.; Clear articulation of future research directions and the need for interdisciplinary advancement.","Objectives are not explicitly recapped in this section; clarity of goals relies on prior sections.; No direct critique or balanced discussion of strengths/weaknesses—largely a forward-looking summary.; No visual summaries (tables, diagrams) included despite the substantial material covered.; Section flow, while logical, could be visually organized with subheadings or bullet points to enhance reader navigation.","In future versions, consider providing a recap of explicit survey objectives in the conclusion.; Include synthesis tables or summary diagrams to help readers anchor key trends and open problems.; Summarize primary controversies or competing views with references to foster a more balanced analytical stance."
gpt-4.1,Pages 37–37,References / Bibliography,"Highly comprehensive and up-to-date citation listing, covering a wide range of topics, journals, arXiv preprints, and recent years.; References include both foundational work and cutting-edge results spanning mathematics, physics, computational geometry, and applied topics.; Formatting is clear and professional.","No contextual discussion of how each work fits into the survey or their relative balance—just the citations.; No insight into how the literature is synthesized, categorized, or compared—just a list.; No analysis, gaps, or forward-looking statements appear in this section.","If not already done elsewhere in the paper, provide a discussion of the literature landscape, typical in a 'Related Works' or 'Literature Review' section.; Summarize, annotate, or thematically organize references to guide readers, especially if the paper is multidisciplinary.; Consider brief commentaries on especially novel or pivotal references within the body of the survey."
gemini-2.5,Pages 37–37,References / Bibliography,"Extensive and current set of references, spanning foundational and cutting-edge works.; References include a diversity of sources—journals, arXiv preprints, and conference proceedings.; Bibliographic entries are formatted clearly and consistently.","No explanatory text, synthesis, or analysis accompanies the references.; No summaries or context to guide the reader in understanding each citation's role.; No discussion of research gaps, trends, or debates based on the references.","Consider annotating key references or providing a categorized bibliography to better guide readers.; Include a brief summary or synthesis elsewhere in the paper to relate the references to the main argument.; Highlight especially seminal works and recent game-changers, linking them to survey themes in-text."
