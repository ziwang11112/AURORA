Parabolic covers, shaped as parabolic cylinders, are shown to be optimal for self-similar processes, due to their nonlinear scaling between time and space aligning geometrically with process self-similarity. The authors derive explicit formulas for the Hausdorff dimension of both the graph and the range of $X + f$, demonstrating that the parabolic Hausdorff dimension of the drift $f$ alone contributes to the overall Hausdorff dimension of $X + f$. Additionally, they provide formulas and bounds for the parabolic Hausdorff dimension."

[Online]. Available: https://ems.press/journals/jfg/articles/15256","This paper develops explicit pointwise and distributional fractal tube formulas for a broad class of relative fractal drums (RFDs), defined as pairs $(A, \Omega)$ of subsets in Euclidean spaces of any dimension, thus generalizing the framework from 1D fractal strings to arbitrary dimensions. The central result expresses the volume of the $t$-neighborhood of $A$ intersected with $\Omega$ as a sum of residues over the complex dimensionsi.e., the polesof the meromorphically continued fractal zeta function associated to $(A, \Omega)$ (either distance or tube zeta function). Key methods include Mellin transforms, residue calculus, and analytic extension techniques, with explicit formulas holding under rigorously stated regularity and analyticity conditions. The complex dimensions encapsulate the oscillatory nature and geometric nuances of various fractal examples, including the Sierpinski gasket, 3D fractal carpets, fractal nests, geometric chirps, self-similar sprays, and the Cantor graph (devil's staircase). The work also proposes a new definition of fractality in terms of nonreal complex dimensions or the presence of a natural boundary in the zeta function, emphasizing cases like the subcritically fractal Cantor graph. This unifying approach allows oscillatory geometric features (such as Minkowski measurability and dimensionality) of highly irregular sets to be analyzed via the singularities of the associated zeta functions, subsuming earlier results and opening pathways for further development in higher-dimensional fractal geometry, spectral theory, and mathematical physics."

Non-smooth geometrical objects have an inherently probabilistic nature and, consequently, introduce stochasticity in the motion of a body that lives in their realm. We use the mathematical concept of fiber bundle to characterize the multivalued nature of geodesic trajectories going through a point that is non-differentiable. Then, we generalize our concepts to everywhere non-smooth structures. The resulting theoretical framework can be considered a hybridization of the theory of surfaces and the theory of stochastic processes. We keep the concepts as general as possible, in order to allow for the introduction of other fundamental processes capable of modeling the fractality or the fluctuations of any conceivable continuous, but non-differentiable space."

The paper defines the general mathematical structure (including use of nontrivial measures, distinct derivative choices, and altered symmetries), and presents comparative tables (e.g., Table 1) highlighting differences between models based on q-derivatives, weighted derivatives, fractional derivatives, and Caputo derivatives. It provides detailed summaries for the actions, propagators, and spectral dimensions of key models (see Table 2), with unitarity issues noted primarily for Caputo-type fractional derivatives. Multifractional frameworks are examined in the context of ordinary matter, gravitation, cosmological scenarios, and are mapped onto quantum gravity proposals including asymptotic safety, noncommutative geometry, causal sets, loop quantum gravity, and string theory, with extensive comparative tables summarizing these relationships. Key open questions include the interpretation and observability of fractional coordinates, the fate of Lorentz and Poincare invariance, technical and physical ambiguities in the treatment of fractional spacetimes, and connecting theoretical predictions with experiments in cosmology and particle physics. The conclusion emphasizes that multifractional models, though facing mathematical and interpretational challenges, provide a flexible landscape for testing spacetime dimensionality at various scales; the field is sufficiently advanced for detailed confrontation with data and for embedding multifractional geometry within the broader patchwork of quantum gravity."

The authors define and analyze key concepts such as conformal dimension, Ahlfors regularity, modulus (both continuous and combinatorial), and the combinatorial Loewner property (CLP), showing through rigorous modulus and porosity arguments that their IGS-based fractal constructions are self-similar, combinatorially Loewner, but not quasisymmetric to any analytic Loewner space. The main theorem provides simple sufficient conditions for IGS-generated limits to satisfy the CLP, and detailed modulus computations are used to verify both Ahlfors regularity ($Q$-regularity) and the inability for these spaces to attain their conformal dimension. The explicit construction involves removing a removable edge in an IGS, leading to a porous subset and achieving a strict inequality between the Assouad and conformal dimensions. This method generalizes examples (such as the Laakso spaces and their variants) and yields tractable, richer classes of fractals where explicit computation of energies and minimal potentials is possible, often homeomorphic to the Menger curve but far from carpet-like spaces. The constructed examples open a new class of combinatorially Loewner spaces outside the quasisymmetric image of classical Loewner spaces, impacting analysis on fractals, geometric group theory, and the study of modulus and conformal dimension. The work sets a foundation for future research into the attainability of conformal dimensions, analytic properties of broader fractal classes, and in-depth analysis of energy forms and $p$-walk dimensions in these new spaces."

Numerical comparisons are performed, focusing on the behavior of quark-gluon plasma (QGP), and demonstrate that the FFPE captures distinct dynamics due to the fractal structure of the momentum space, differing from the classic FPE.

Available: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13258","The paper introduces a framework for constructing self-similar $p$-energy forms as normalized limits of discretized $p$-energies on a broad class of Laakso-type fractal spaces termed IGS-fractals (edge-iterated graph systems). Building on the analytic richness of Laakso spaces, the authors propose IGS-fractals as versatile ""toy models"" for exploring phenomena not otherwise tractable on conventional fractals. Central to their contribution is the discovery of a singularity in Sobolev spaces, where the intrinsic Sobolev spaces $\mathscr{F}_{p_1}$ and $\mathscr{F}_{p_2}$ for distinct exponents $p_1, p_2 \in (1, \infty)$ intersect only at constant functions. This phenomenon is explicitly demonstrated for the Laakso diamond space and analogous IGS-fractals, providing the first self-similar fractal instance with this universal intersection property across exponents. The methods rely on constructing Dirichlet forms through graph approximations and taking normalized limits, with careful combinatorial analysis ensuring convergence and self-similarity. The results delineate the geometry of limit energies, profile the singularity phenomenon, and relate energy measures to geometric invariants like the capacity dimension. The discussion highlights the limitations of classical intuition in these highly singular metric spaces and suggests the framework's utility for future studies in analysis, probability, and geometric group theory, with open directions for non-symmetric energies and stochastic processes."

The authors introduce a new criterion for characterizing finite topological systems using bulk conductivity of edge modes, complementing the real-space winding number (RSWN), which can be unreliable in small samples or near phase transitions. Analytical and numerical studies demonstrate that while RSWN deviates for small systems, it converges to k-space predictions with increasing size. Bulk conductivity phase diagramscomputed via the RSWN formulaoffer experimentally accessible means to determine topological phases, remaining robust under symmetry-respecting disorder, and even benefiting from certain chemical potential disorder that breaks chiral symmetry by shifting phase transition points toward ideal values. The combined approach of RSWN and bulk conductivity provides a robust framework for topology identification in intermediate-scale experiments using platforms like synthetic Rydberg atom arrays and quantum dots. Future work will extend these findings to higher-dimensional systems and further benchmarking of experimental topology. Overall, the study supports bulk conductivity as essential for accurately characterizing topology in realistic systems, contributing to both material design and understanding of topological physics."

The intermediate value property holds with careful exceptions at discontinuities.

By employing vertical scaling matrices that are constructed using $S$ evaluated at partition points and analyzing their spectral radii, the authors derive upper and lower bounds for the oscillation of $f$, leading to an explicit formula for $\dim_B \Gamma_f$ under certain structural matrix conditions. The methodology generalizes classical results for constant or linear $S$, demonstrating that the geometric complexity of the graph is intrinsically linked to the spectral properties of associated matrices. A concrete example with partition $N=3$ and a step function $S(x)$ illustrates the computation. The results are sharp when the spectral radius condition (greater than one) is satisfied; however, degenerate cases require more elaborate analysis. The work sets the stage for future exploration of less regular scaling functions, randomization, and extensions to higher dimensions and more general partition structures.

By defining a linear structure on an interval of the projective plane and considering iterated function systems (IFS) composed of affine projective contractions, the authors construct fractal graphs as attractors of such systemsthese are continuous functions exhibiting rich topological and geometric properties. Explicitly, if the IFS consists of $d$ contractions with ratios $r_1,\ldots,r_d$, then the box-counting, packing, and Hausdorff dimensions of the fractal graph all coincide and are determined as the unique solution $s > 0$ to the Moran-type equation $\sum_{i=1}^d r_i^s = 1$. The attractors possess topological dimension one but can exhibit fractal dimensions strictly greater than one and arbitrarily close to two as contraction ratios increase, thus producing highly irregular ""wild"" functions. The work recovers the classical Euclidean results as a limiting case and illustrates both theoretical advancements and computational challenges in adapting separation conditions and visualizations to the projective context.

Building upon foundational work by Jarnik (who showed that bounded partial quotients lead to dimension one) and Good (who discovered a ""dimension drop"" to $1/2$ for coefficients tending to infinity), the authors generalize and unify much of the existing dimension-drop literature. They characterize the Hausdorff dimension of such sets in terms of thermodynamic pressure equations, employing methods such as mass distribution principles, construction of Cantor-type sets, and multifractal analysis. The main theorem offers a precise formula linking dimension to growth rates, thereby explaining the transition of dimension from $1$ to $1/2$ and further towards $0$ as constraints on the coefficients become stricter. Applications include new proofs for the dimension of Borel-Bernstein sets, a complete resolution of dimension gaps from Liao and Rams, and sharp results for liminf/limsup sets concerning the maximum partial quotient. The work also discusses the sensitivity of these dimensions to many parameter choices, explores implications for Fractal Geometry and Diophantine approximation, and outlines open problems and future directions such as multifractal spectra for irregular growth and connections to dynamical systems. Overall, the authors provide an essentially complete solution to a significant open problem in fractal and number theory, captured by the following dimension formula: for the set $E(\varphi) = \{x : a_n(x) \geq \varphi(n)\,\, \text{for all large}\,\, n\}$, the Hausdorff dimension $\dim_H(E(\varphi))$ is determined as the unique $s$ satisfying the pressure equation $P(s, \varphi) = 0$, where $P$ involves the growth rate of $\varphi$ and the statistical properties of continued fractions."

Importantly, their argument removes the need for assuming Poincare or volume doubling properties, extending the applicability of EHI stability far beyond classical scenarios. The methods are robust to irregularities and do not require strong global regularity or established heat kernel bounds, clarifying the geometric and analytic features that dictate when the EHI holds.

The central achievement is a proof of the Alekseevskii conjecture, confirming that any homogeneous Einstein manifold with negative scalar curvature is diffeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^n$ (Euclidean space), i.e., topologically trivial, with every such space shown to be a solvmanifold. The Einstein condition is characterized by the Ricci tensor equation $\operatorname{ric}(g) = \lambda g$ for $\lambda < 0$, and the authors employ tools from geometric invariant theory, a modified Helmholtz decomposition for vector fields, divergence formulas, the Bochner technique, and Riemannian submersions (using O'Neill formulas) to analyze the implications of isometric group actions and the structure of orbits. Further results include that any homogeneous expanding Ricci soliton is isometric to a solvsoliton and that any compact, locally homogeneous Einstein manifold with negative scalar curvature must be locally symmetric.

The authors introduce a randomized algorithm that employs numerical continuation along rigid continuation pathsusing rigid motions of the equations instead of the usual linear pathswhich leads to a lower average condition number and permits larger steps. Methodologically, the core innovations include the split gamma number (a refinement of Smale's classical gamma number) and the restriction of averaging to random rigid motions, yielding superior estimates for the average number of continuation steps. For a system of $n$ homogeneous equations of degree at most $D$, the algorithm requires $O(n^4 D^2)$ continuation steps and $O(n^6 D^4 N)$ total operations, given input size $N$. Analytical results are established under the Kostlan distribution, leveraging its unitary invariance.

Instead, for $n \geq 2$, if $E \subset \mathbb{H}^n$ is H-perimeter minimizing near $0$ and $\nu_E(0) = (1,0,\ldots,0)$, the blow-up limit $\varphi$ solves weakly in $D_{1/4}$ the PDE $\frac{\partial}{\partial y_1} \Delta_0 \varphi = 0$, where $\Delta_0 = \frac{\partial^2}{\partial y_1^2} + \sum_{i=2}^n X_i^2 + Y_i^2$; for strongly H-perimeter minimizing sets, the equation simplifies to $\Delta_0 \varphi = 0$. The methodology involves refined blow-up analysis, weak convergence techniques, and corrected first variation computations using contact flows, showing subtle effects of the Heisenberg groups non-commutativity.

It shows that if $Z$ has sufficiently many subspaces, then the space of bounded metrics on $Z$ is universal for all bounded metric spaces with cardinality at most that of $Z$; in particular, for spaces like $l^2(\kappa)$, $Q$ (rationals), and other classical objects, explicit universality results are given, often via operator-theoretic and embedding constructions. For infinite discrete $Z$, the metric space of metrics on $Z$ is universal for all separable metric spaces, and spaces like $\ell^\infty(\kappa)$ are realized as subspaces. However, when $Z$ is compact and countable, universality fails: there exist compact metric spaces that cannot be isometrically embedded into $\mathrm{Met}(Z)$. On the positive side, every compact subset of $c_0(\omega_0)$ embeds isometrically into $\mathrm{Met}(Z)$ for countably infinite $Z$. The analysis connects functional analysis, topology, and set theory, with explicit embedding techniques (using theorems on extension, Banach space embeddings, and transfinite constructions), and raises open problems about universality for unbounded spaces, finite injectivity, and embeddings of the Urysohn space.

Available: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03128","This paper establishes that for uniformly locally finite metric spaces, isomorphic Roe algebras imply the spaces are coarsely equivalent, resolving a central question in C*-rigidity that bridges operator algebra and coarse geometry. Roe algebras, constructed from large-scale geometric data of metric spaces, serve as operator-algebraic invariants, and the main result proves a complete correspondence: $C^*$-algebra isomorphism of Roe algebras characterizes coarse equivalence of the underlying spaces with bounded geometry. The methods include careful development of mathematical preliminaries, key technical results such as a concentration inequality (Lemma 3.1) and analysis of quasilocality (Proposition 3.2), and construction of coarse equivalences from spatially implemented isomorphisms and unitary elements (Theorems 2.14, 2.15). A further main result identifies the outer automorphism group of the Roe algebra, $\operatorname{Out}(C^*_{\mathrm{Roe}}(X))$, with the group of coarse equivalences of $X$ up to closeness, showing this correspondence is canonical and functorial. The table of correspondences is:

Specifically, for $d=3$, it demonstrates that a $p^n \times p^n \times p^n$ block constructed from such operators decomposes as a tensor product of gauge-equivalent operators akin to the original $\mathcal R$, revealing a self-similar block structure. This self-similarity persists when generalizing to commutative algebras and when introducing Boltzmann weights for spin configurations; the resulting partition functions and correlation functions also exhibit non-trivial self-similar decompositions. The work proves a conjecture that this property holds for all finite characteristics $p$, and provides explicit algebraic constructions and examples illustrating these decompositions. Overall, it highlights a robust algebraic block self-similarity in non-integrable settings, suggesting new structural tools for statistical models without relying on traditional integrability or YangBaxter-type constraints."

Our main result establishes that the spectra of these self-similar almost Mathieu operators can be completely described by the spectra of the corresponding self-similar Laplacians through the spectral decimation framework used in the context of spectral analysis on fractals. In addition, the self-similar structure of our model provides a natural finite graph approximation model. This approximation is not only helpful in executing the numerical simulation, but is also useful in finding the spectral decimation function via Schur complement computations of given finite-dimensional matrices. The self-similar Laplacians used in our model were considered recently by Chen and Teplyaev who proved the emergence of singularly continuous spectra for specific parameters.

To address this limitation, the paper introduces a statistical mechanics approach using the $\kappa$-probability function from Kaniadakis statistics, leading to a generalization of the GR law capable of modeling earthquake distributions over a wide magnitude range. This $\kappa$-generalized GR law is tested on over 150,000 recorded earthquakes from six global regions, demonstrating superior performance, particularly for low-magnitude events where the standard GR law is inadequate.

The approach formulates the determination of similarity variables as a minimization problem, seeking the collapse of experimental or numerical profiles, and reconstructs their analytic form using symbolic regression under constraints like dimensional homogeneity and power-law scaling. The method is validated on five canonical fluid mechanics problems: it successfully recovers classical similarity variables for the laminar boundary layer, Burgers' equation, free turbulent wakes, and collapsing cavities, aligning with known analytic results such as Blasius and inviscid scaling (e.g., $(t_0-t)^{2/3}$ for cavity collapse). In the case of grid-generated turbulence, where classical two-scale similarity (integral and Kolmogorov) would be expected, the method instead discovers a novel empirical scaling involving the Taylor microscale, $\lambda = L^{1/3} \eta^{2/3}$. While the single-scale extraction method struggles with inherently multi-scale processes, it reliably identifies underlying self-similarities in a range of problems, highlighting its robustness and generality.

The authors prove that, for any such sequence, the existence of a winning strategy for Player II again characterizes sets of dimension $\leq \delta$. Crucially, the unfolded version of this game enables the transfer of powerful regularity results from Baire category to Hausdorff dimension: under the axiom of determinacy (AD), any wellordered union of sets of dimension $\leq \delta$ has dimension $\leq \delta$, and a continuous uniformization theorem for Hausdorff dimension is obtained. Additionally, for analytic sets (or arbitrary sets under AD) of dimension $\geq \delta$, any $0 < \delta' < \delta$ guarantees the existence of compact subsets of dimension at least $\delta'$. These results demonstrate how game-theoretic frameworks can extend regularity properties from classical descriptive set theory to fractal geometry. The methods highlight new analogies and invite future research into weakening dependence on AD, exploring other fractal dimensions, and examining connections with Diophantine approximation and dynamical systems."

Shrinking Ricci solitons, as generalizations of Einstein manifolds, are critical to understanding Ricci flow singularities and the geometry of Kahler manifolds, yet a complete four-real-dimensional classification was previously hindered by the lack of a soliton on this specific blowup.

The authors establish that such algebras, while naturally forming operator algebras, do not always coincide with multiplier algebras of any reasonable nc reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), especially outside row ball cases. Employing tools from nc function theory, RKHS theory, and operator algebra representation theory (notably including the boundary value principle, Nullstellensatz, and concepts such as completely contractive representations and matrix spans), the study presents classification theorems for operator algebras of nc functions on homogeneous subvarieties, showing these are completely isometrically isomorphic precisely when their underlying subvarieties are nc biholomorphic. Key results include extension and rigidity theorems for nc maps between subvarieties of injective operator balls; notably, every biholomorphism between homogeneous varieties can be extended to the ambient ball and linearized. The algebraic structure of uniformly continuous nc functions on these balls (and their subvarieties) thus serves as a complete invariant, determining the operator space up to completely isometric isomorphism. The challenges are highlighted by the non-extension of several commutative or row ball phenomena to general nc operator balls, such as the absence of a universal multiplier structure and the role of injectivity in extension theorems.

Focusing on the regime $1<p\neq 2<\infty$, the main result (Theorem A) shows that $S_p$-bounded idempotent Schur multipliers must, under a mild transversality condition, be locally modeled on the classical triangular projection and correspond to domains locally of the form $\{(x, y) : f_1(x) > f_2(y)\}$ for $\mathcal{C}^1$-functions $f_1, f_2$, with $S_p$-boundedness being equivalent to a local boundary flatness condition. This geometric criterion is confirmed by combining analytic methods from operator theory with geometric transversality and curvature arguments, utilizing tools like square-function estimates and the implicit function theorem. As a significant application (Theorem B), the authors fully characterize local $L_p$-boundedness of smooth Fourier idempotents on connected Lie groups, revealing they are all modeled on one of three fundamental examplesthe classical, affine, and projective Hilbert transformsthereby extending Feffermans ball multiplier theorem into noncommutative and Lie-theoretic settings. The work highlights intriguing differences between the local abundance of Schur idempotents and the rigidity of Fourier idempotents, delivers sharp classification results for various group types (including the nonexistence of $L_p$-idempotents for certain simple Lie groups), and addresses longstanding conjectures related to approximation properties and operator-algebraic rigidity. The study leaves open several avenues for future research, such as global characterizations beyond local theory and analysis on exceptional Lie group cases."

Available: https://doi.org/10.1017/fmp.2022.3","This paper presents a new approach to the problem of tiling the integers and cyclic groups by finite sets, focusing on sets $A \subset \mathbb{Z}$ that, when translated by elements of a set $B$, cover $\mathbb{Z}_M$ without overlaps, i.e., $A \oplus B = \mathbb{Z}_M$ for some $M \in \mathbb{N}$. Building on classical results, such as Newman's bound $M \leq 2^{\max(A)-\min(A)}$ and recent progress by Greenfeld and Tao, the authors develop innovative toolsincluding the box product, multiscale cuboids, and saturating setsfusing harmonic analysis and combinatorial methods to provide new tiling and cyclotomic divisibility criteria. Through these methods, the paper addresses structural classification for tilings, especially when the period $M$ is divisible by three or more distinct odd primes, and proves that all tilings of period $(pqr)^2$ satisfy the CovenMeyerowitz 'T2' condition. The framework also enables reconstructing tiling sets from partial data, introducing reduction techniques that simplify tiling problems to cases with more tractable structure. Key results are summarized in criteria and structure theorems for saturated and fibered sets, addressing challenges such as computational complexity and the lack of subgroup theorems for higher prime divisors. The discussion connects the findings to open problems like Fugledes conjecture, and the conclusion underscores the significance of these new tools in advancing the systematic study and classification of integer and group tilings, laying groundwork for further combinatorial and analytic exploration in higher dimensions and more general group settings."

Available: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10851","This paper examines when specific approximation-theoretic properties of subspaces in Banach spacessuch as being $M$-ideals, possessing the generalized center property $(GC)$, central subspaces, or best simultaneous approximation capabilities (e.g., $\mathscr{F}$-rcp, $(P_1)$, SACP)are preserved under the operation of taking sums of two subspaces or in various function/tensor product frameworks. While the folklore suggests that the sum of two $M$-ideals is an $M$-ideal, and similarly for semi $M$-ideals, the authors provide explicit counterexamples demonstrating that crucial properties (e.g., $(GC)$ and central subspaces) do not always persist in $Y+Z$ even if both $Y$ and $Z$ have them and $Y+Z$ is closed. They establish, with theorems and constructive counterexamples, the nuanced conditions under which properties such as $(GC)$ can be inheritede.g., Theorem 2.2 shows $Y\in(GC)$ if $X\in(GC)$ and $Y$ is almost constrained in $X$, while other results chart both preservation and failure for sums, Kothe-Bochner spaces, polyhedral sums, and injective tensor products. The investigation also advances the understanding of when best approximation properties (including SACP and $(P_1)$) hold for sums of subspaces, resolves an open problem about $M$-ideals with local constrainedness, and poses ongoing challenges about whether there exist distinct subspaces $Y, Z$ (beyond those constructed herein) with SACP whose closed sum fails SACP, emphasizing the open-ended nature of stability limitations in Banach space approximation theory."

Available: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13458","Tight wavelet frames (TWFs) in $L^2(\mathbb{R}^n)$ are valuable due to their perfect reconstruction property, but current construction methods face challenges: extension-based approaches lack explicit techniques for mother wavelet generation, and sum of squares (SOS)-based approaches still require addressing the SOS problem even with specific mother wavelet construction. Typically, TWF construction starts from a given refinable function, making mother wavelet discovery particularly burdensome. This work proposes new TWF construction techniques that distribute this burden between both refinable functions and mother wavelets, providing alternative solutions to the SOS problem and demonstrating the methodology with examples."

Improved versions of these inequalities are derived by analyzing extremizer stability, and in higher-order cases, Hardy-Rellich type inequalities are established for all radial operators in the Grushin setting, with proofs that all constants obtained are sharp. For $L^2$ higher-order cases, the authors also compute exact remainder terms through the creation of equalities rather than inequalities."

The central result states that $P_p(X)$ is non-branching if and only if $X$ is non-branching, forging a deep link between the geodesic structure of $X$ and that of its Wasserstein space. The study introduces MCP-spacesspaces with a locally unique geodesic structureshowing that their metric tangent cones at every point are normed vector spaces (even without strict convexity of the norm) and classifies these tangents comprehensively. Several equivalent characterizations are established, including that $X$ is non-branching if and only if all tangent cones at every $x \in X$ are uniquely geodesic. Further, the paper provides an alternative proof of the CheegerColding splitting theorem within this framework and describes the full range of MCP-spaces. The results yield a cohesive structural theory for non-branching in optimal transport, give practical intrinsic criteria for identifying such spaces, and open avenues for extensions to broader classes of metric measure spaces and further study of analytic properties on these spaces."

The main result establishes that for $k\geq2$, the vertical perimeter is controlled by the horizontal: $|\partial_{v}\Omega|\lesssim \frac{1}{k}|\partial_{h}\Omega|$. This is achieved via a new decomposition of finite-perimeter sets into pieces permitting an ""intrinsic corona decomposition,"" enabling the passage from a $W^{1,2}\to L_2(L_2)$ boundedness in lower dimensions to an endpoint $W^{1,1}\to L_2(L_1)$ case for certain singular integrals.
