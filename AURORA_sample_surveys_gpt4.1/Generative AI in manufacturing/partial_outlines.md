    [1] Industrial automation is undergoing a transformation as the Industrial Internet brings advanced computing, communication, and storage through cloud computing and field devices, moving the traditional ISA-95 pyramid model to a two-layer architecture composed of industrial cloud and edge computing. This shift necessitates a new approach to industrial software, moving away from dedicated applications towards service-based solutions that maximize flexibility, interoperability, and efficiency by integrating the IEC 61499 standard, microservice architecture, and containerization. The paper presents orchestration methods and deployment procedures for OT-IT hybrid industrial edge applications, substantiating the feasibility of the approach with an industrial case study and an accompanying performance analysis.
    [2] Artificial intelligence-driven automation has gradually become the technical trend of the new automation era. In this article, we model the learning and decision-making process of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with a statistical physical percolation model. Based on the differentiation degree and vulnerability, the relationship between the classification reliability and the physical model is constructed. A theoretical explanation is provided for the difference in reliability among CNNs with different structures and learning abilities. The relationship between the differentiation degree and vulnerability is analyzed from both adversarial attack and adversarial training perspectives. Experimental results in the industrial automation domain verify the validity and universality of the model.
    [3] Amid growing demands for efficient, customizable manufacturing driven by Industry 4.0, this paper addresses the challenges of distributing traditional centralized numerical control kernels (NCK) in computerized manufacturing systems. The authors propose an architecture where each axis module is equipped with an IIoT-enabled low-level controller (LLC) that manages local control and communicates via a network interface, facilitating interoperability and reconfigurability. These smart resources coordinate with an edge-based high-level controller (HLC) that specifies trajectories and schedules tasks over the network. The paper examines real-time and network bandwidth requirements for various mappings of NCK layers to LLCs and HLC, presenting trade-offs in distributed motion control design, and demonstrates that their approachusing industry-grade robots and affordable IoT hardwareachieves minimal accuracy loss compared to centralized systems, as validated against ISO 230 and ISO 10791-7 standards.
    [4] In this work, fault detection and isolation (FDI) in closed-loop industrial automation systems is addressed by extending the Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) method to better account for closed-loop dynamics, aiming to improve detection performance in such environments; the approach relates to multivariate analysis, sensitivity analysis, and residual separation, and leverages data-driven techniques for enhanced fault detection and isolation, as indicated in the keywords.
    [5] The paper proposes a two-stage method (OEC-IRRL) for achieving submillimeter-precision robotic insertion tasks using only visual inputs, targeting challenges in flexible, semi-structured industrial settings where component position and orientation vary. The system combines an eye-to-hand vision system for initial object localization and trajectory planning with a hybrid Imitation Learning (IL) and Residual Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach for fine adjustment. A single demonstration is used to extract key via-points with velocity-based motion mode switch detection, and a base policy is trained using Piece-wise Via-point Movement Primitives (VMP). Online, a Soft Actor-Critic RL algorithm further refines the policy in contact-rich regions, with selective activation near bottleneck poses, leveraging local compliance controllers that integrate vision and force feedback. Experiments on gear assembly demonstrate a 100% success rate, 14.92s average completion time, and 46% improvement in success rate over model-based and visual servoing baselines, highlighting robust adaptation and efficiency with minimal demonstration data. The method efficiently constrains RL exploration, boosting sample efficiency, but does not yet address generalization to radically different tasks or real-time anomaly handling. Future work includes expanding the method for fault recovery, unstructured environments, and integrating large language models for more versatile planning and reasoning.

[26] Both Industry 4.0 and sustainability are prominent in academic, managerial, and policy discussions, but the connection between them remains unclear due to fragmented literature. This paper addresses this gap by systematically reviewing 117 peer-reviewed journal articles, conducting both descriptive and content analyses to present a new conceptualization and theoretical framework. The study advances the understanding of how Industry 4.0 technologies affect sustainability practices and performance, offering contributions to both theoretical knowledge and practical applications.

[27] The main objective of this research is to identify current trends in Industry 4.0 within the manufacturing sector through bibliometric analysis. Using a dataset of 1,069 documents from 2020 to 2024 sourced from the Web of Science and analyzed with the R-Bibliometrix package, the study identifies research trends, leading authors, and key institutional contributions. A notable publication growth rate of 30.77% underscores significant research interest. Thematic analysis highlights the convergence of Industry 4.0 with sustainability, artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, smart manufacturing, and digitalization. Emphasis is placed on transitioning to smarter, more efficient, and sustainable manufacturing systems, though management, technological integration, and strategic challenges remain. Sustainability and machine learning are recognized as key enablers, with security and collaboration gaining prominence in recent years. Research contributions are geographically widespread, featuring strong international cooperation, particularly from India, Italy, and China. Influential journals include Sustainability and the Journal of Manufacturing Systems. Citation network and thematic evolution analyses reveal the broad, multidimensional impact of Industry 4.0 technologies on manufacturing.

[28] Smart manufacturing processes and systems have received great attention through the latest innovations, ongoing efforts, and best practices in the Industry 4.0 ...

[29] Despite limited prior research on business models for sustainable innovation in Industry 4.0, this study utilizes data from sources including Ad Hoc Research, BCG, BDO, Capgemini, CIO, EY, and McKinsey to estimate the effects of Industry 4.0 on workforce percentage changes, planned adoption rates of advanced technologies among manufacturers, and average realized overall productivity gains from smart factories. With a dataset comprising 5,200 respondents, the research model is supported through analyses employing structural equation modeling and probability sampling, using data gathered via a self-administered questionnaire.

[30] This article reviews recent literature on Industry 4.0-based manufacturing systems, leveraging data from BCG, Deloitte, PwC, and Statista to analyze aspects such as Industry 4.0 implementation across the value chain (measured in %), global revenues from artificial intelligence in enterprise applications between 2018 and 2025 (in million U.S. dollars), and the Industry 4.0 framework, including its contributing digital technologies (%).
