gpt-4.1,Pages 31–32,References,"Extremely comprehensive and up-to-date citation coverage spanning major subfields and methodologies.; References include recent preprints, arXiv, major journals, and conference papers from 2023-2025.; Wide topical and disciplinary reach, including both technical detail and ethical/social considerations.","No narrative content, synthesis, or contextual explanation accompanies the references.; A few formatting breaks and minor inconsistencies (e.g., wrapping of DOIs and line breaks) that interrupt flow.; No sectional structure, topical grouping, or summary—just a flat list.","Consider adding brief annotations or categorization/grouping (e.g., by method, domain, year) to aid readers.; Review reference formatting for consistency and resolve any line-break/column-wrap artifacts.; If permitted, provide a short overview or highlight particularly seminal or recent references."
gemini-2.5,Pages 31–32,References/Bibliography,"Extremely comprehensive coverage of the literature spanning foundational and current works across multiple subfields including synthetic data, data augmentation, generative modeling, and responsible deployment.; References are current, including several from 2023-2025, and span high-impact journals, IEEE, Nature Machine Intelligence, and arXiv.; References include methodological, theoretical, and application-oriented works.","As a reference list, it contains no analysis, summarization, or integration.; No section or headings—only a plain list.; No figures, tables, or summaries to reinforce takeaways.; Does not specify audience, objectives, or highlight research gaps directly.","If this is the main reference section, consider grouping references thematically (e.g., by method, application domain) for easier navigation.; If intended to support a survey, ensure cross-referencing in the main text for maximal integration.; For improved usability, a table of seminal works or recent trends could be included elsewhere in the paper."
claude-3.7,Pages 31–32,References,"Extensive and up-to-date list with many relevant works from 2023-2025.; Citations span sub-fields in computer vision, synthetic data, generative models, and related AI developments.","Some minor formatting inconsistencies (e.g., line breaks interrupting DOIs or URLs).; No analysis, synthesis, or evaluation of the literature in this section—it's strictly a bibliography.","Standardize formatting to ensure all DOIs and URLs are unbroken for easier access.; If this is intended to close the paper, a brief closing paragraph or synthesis could help reinforce key insights for the reader."
