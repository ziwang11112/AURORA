gpt-4.1,Pages 1–3,0,Literature,Comprehensiveness,5,"Comprehensiveness is very strong, with extensive citation in all subsections, and the survey draws from multiple subdomains and sources, but as only 3 pages are visible, it's not possible to ensure absolutely no gaps. Balance is good, strengths and weaknesses are discussed (e.g., ensemble/consensus vs. feature dependencies). Currency is inferred from references to recent techniques and frameworks, but the actual years of cited works aren't specified by number."
