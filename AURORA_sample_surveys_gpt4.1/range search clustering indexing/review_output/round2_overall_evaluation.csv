These do not detract significantly from the overall strength and originality of the work.","Clear articulation of objectives and systematic treatment of goals.; Comprehensive and integrative analysis across subfields.; Thoughtful discussion of theoretical, practical, and even ethical/societal issues.; Well-structured presentation with clear sectioning and effective summarization.; Introduction of a new unifying taxonomy and a concrete roadmap for the field.",Only one table as visual support — additional figures could support synthesis.; Full reference accuracy cannot be absolutely confirmed without the bibliography.; Potential for minor citation gaps not directly observable in this excerpt.,"Add conceptual or roadmap figures to supplement the taxonomy visualization.; Perform an audit of the bibliography to ensure complete, up-to-date coverage, especially in citing the very latest preprints and conference advances.; Maintain the high level of synthesis in visual and textual summaries throughout the paper.",4.8,accept
gpt-4.1,Pages 40–42,"This section effectively synthesizes the survey's main threads, identifies major open directions, and anchors them with an impressively comprehensive, current reference list. It strongly supports literature awareness and articulates key challenges for the future, though with limited critical analysis or visual synthesis at the end.",Unusually thorough and current literature review.; High relevance to current interdisciplinary work in high-dimensional data analytics.; Effective forward-looking summary of open challenges and objectives for the field.,"No figures, tables, or concept maps to help readers assimilate the broad and deep cited material.; Section structure and summarization could be improved.; Balance is limited by presentation as exhaustive references rather than thematic discussion—fewer comparative insights.","Strengthen section structure (clear separation of conclusion vs. references).; Add summary visuals (tables, diagrams) to help synthesize and categorize literature.; Broaden critical analysis by linking references to key thematic challenges and tradeoffs.",4.1,minor revision
gemini-2.5,Pages 40–42,"This section excels in providing a broad, up-to-date reference backbone for the field and delivers a thoughtful, if high-level, synthesis of challenges and directions in high-dimensional clustering and indexing. While methodologically sound, it lacks the analytic and organizational depth that might make the conclusion more actionable or insightful for advanced researchers.",Encompasses an impressive breadth and recency of references; Highlights ethical and societal imperatives alongside technical advances; Academic tone and formatting are professional,Limited discussion of the survey's precise objectives; No visuals or structured summarization in the conclusion; Analysis is broad but not deeply critical or comparative,Enhance explicitness and measurability of objectives in the conclusion.; Consider visual summarization of future challenges/opportunities.; Provide more structured synthesis or systematic comparison of literature perspectives.,3.9,minor revision
claude-3.7,Pages 40–42,"This section effectively synthesizes the survey's contributions, outlines societal and technical imperatives, and provides a rich, current reference base. It excels in currency, comprehensiveness, and clearly framing future research challenges. However, the lack of explicit objectives, visuals, and summary structures in this segment lessens its impact.",Extremely comprehensive and current reference list covering multiple subfields.; Clear identification of open research directions and integration of ethical/technical challenges.; Professional and concise academic tone.,No explicit statement of section objectives.; No figures or visual summaries included.; Section headings and summary synthesis could be clearer.,Clarify section boundaries and add explicit headings.; Include a visual or tabular synthesis of key takeaways in the concluding section.; Briefly restate main objectives at the end to reinforce alignment with stated goals.,4.2,minor revision
