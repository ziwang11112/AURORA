claude-3.7,Pages 31–33,Synthesis and Future/Persistent Challenges,"Clearly summarizes the technological advances, integration challenges, and clinical impact of multimodal AI for healthcare.; Identifies and details persistent challenges (standardization, explainability, equity, etc.), adding a concise summary table mapping impacts to interventions.; Draws from diverse, recent, and authoritative references, demonstrating strong literature command.; Highlights links to the survey’s stated objectives and guides readers toward actionable research directions.",Restates objectives but doesn’t introduce a wholly new conceptual framework or taxonomy in this section.; Some analysis is more synthetic/interpretative than deeply critical or theoretical.; The continued reference to 'the survey’s objectives' would rely on context from earlier sections for complete clarity.,"If not present elsewhere in the paper, explicitly introduce a unique organizing framework or conceptual model.; Incorporate deeper critique or theoretical discussion of the systemic causes or solutions to the outlined challenges.; Ensure earlier sections provide a succinct, explicit statement of objectives (if not already present) to best align the synthesis."
gpt-4.1,Pages 34–34,References [71]–[102],"Extensive and current coverage of literature, including recent (2023-2025) works, preprints, and foundational studies.; Clear formatting and consistent citation style, making the references easy to trace.; Direct relevance to the field of multimodal learning, healthcare AI, and related technical domains.","No narrative, synthesis, or context provided here, as it is purely a reference section.; No summaries, integration, or identification of gaps—analysis is not possible within this segment.","No substantive suggestions for reference lists except to maintain accuracy, completeness, and consistency.; If space allows, authors could consider adding a table of most influential works or a brief synthesis/summary for key clusters of references elsewhere in the survey."
gemini-2.5,Pages 34–34,References / Bibliography,"Extensive and up-to-date literature coverage with 30+ citations from high-impact journals, conferences, and preprints.; Accurate and professional formatting of references.; Diverse, relevant citations across biomedical, AI, and multimodal domains.","This section presents only references with no accompanying analysis, summaries, or integration.; No section or topic synthesis, balance of perspectives, or identification of research gaps.",Ensure all references are discussed and critically evaluated within the main body of the survey.; Link references to specific survey points to increase clarity and synthesis.; Future versions could enhance the bibliography with brief context/anecdotes or grouped categories for easier navigation.
claude-3.7,Pages 34–34,References,Comprehensive citation list spanning a wide array of domains and the most current literature.; Citations are well formatted and consistently styled.; Up-to-date references demonstrate strong awareness of the state of the field.,"No narrative or commentary to contextualize the references.; Does not establish objectives, relevance, or connections to the rest of the work.; Lacks analysis, synthesis, or discussion of the cited literature.","If included as a bibliography, ensure these references are properly cited in relevant survey sections.; Consider including a brief summary or annotation for each reference if this is a standalone annotated bibliography.; Make sure earlier sections of the survey integrate these works effectively for analytical and organizational coherence."
